And there's a lot to be said for a well-acted, attractively shot drama that has its heart so firmly in the right place. But after a few queasy moments at its midpoint, the trajectory of In a Better World becomes so relentlessly platitudinous that an audience that ought to feel seriously rattled will be settling back, feeling comfortably reassured. That's not true early on, as Bier cuts between Anton (Mikael Persbrandt), a humanitarian Danish doctor dealing with the aftereffects of tribal violence in an unspecified African nation, and his put-upon adolescent son Elias (Markus Rygaard), who's at home and being tormented in his father's absence by a school bully. Elias finds an ally when Christian (William Johnk Nielsen) joins the class - a well-spoken, polite kid whose anger at his mother's recent death (from cancer) needs an outlet. Christian's philosophy about dealing with bullies, which is basically that if you hit back hard enough the first time, you won't need to hit back again, isn't one that school authorities would likely approve. But it changes the dynamics of Elias' life pretty quickly. It also has predictably dire repercussions when the boys decide to apply it to other conflicts. Papa Anton, meanwhile, is confronted with ethical dilemmas of his own when Big Man, a brutal local warlord whose savagery keeps Anton's operating table full, comes in with a life-threatening wound. From there Bier whips absent parents, pipe bombs, the Hippocratic oath, marital infidelity, impotent authority figures and other ingredients into a potent melodramatic brew that poses but doesn't answer such questions as whether violence is sometimes necessary or always a poisoner of souls, and whether turning the other cheek establishes moral authority or destabilizes social order. Contrasting warm African golds with chilly Danish greens, the director matches striking visuals with overtly melodramatic situations - children with access to rooftops and fireworks to get your protective juices flowing, predators so unsubtle their comeuppance seems a foregone conclusion. Bier creates some genuinely disturbing moments - a scene in which Anton allows a bullying father to strike him again and again in front of the kids, a harrowing exchange with Big Man as the thug begins to heal - but resolves them in ways that allow the audience, if not her protagonists, to shrug off moral consequences. There's sufficient craft that you go along with the twists, even as Bier is wrapping things up with a neatly tied bow. But in a better world, In a Better World would be a better movie. ' \n",

At Kendall Square Cinema: C+ Painter-turned-director Julian Schnabel (Oscar-nominated for his exquisite “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”) has built a terrific second career from filmed biographies (also in-cluding “Before Night Falls” and “Basquiat”) that deal with people confined by circumstance yearning to break free. I’d love to report that his fourth film, “Miral,” continues the upward trend, but the screenplay by Schnabel’s girlfriend, Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal (based on her semiautobiographical novel), contains too many earnest platitudes in its one-sided look at four women’s intertwining lives during the first intifada of the 1980s. (Some musical choices, such as Tom Waits’ “All the World Is Green” playing over a climactic funeral, also stand out in a bad way.) Miral (Freida Pinto, “Slumdog Millionaire”), the young Arab woman growing up in Jerusalem during this period, doesn’t enter the picture immediately, and when she does, she doesn’t have much to say — at first. (A bit of a good thing, because Pinto’s Indian-accented English doesn’t quite jibe with the Arabic-tinged tongues of her co-stars.) Beginning in war-torn Jerusalem circa 1948, when “Mama” Hind Husseini (Hiam Abbass, “The Visitor”) established an orphanage for refugees that quickly becomes home to 2,000, the movie spans the next 50 years, and though Schnabel’s artist’s eye is on display, the Israel /Palestine conflict is a subject that he never brings into clear focus — at least with regard to Israelis. And when he presents what some would believe terrorist actions of his protagonists, he sidesteps the potentially horrible consequences: a disgraced former nurse — a lifesaver — plants a bomb in a crowded movie theater (playing, without a hint of subtlety, Roman Polanski’s “Repulsion”) but the device fails to explode; a car bomb is set off by Miral’s political activist boyfriend — though there are seemingly no casualties. So much for the horrors of war. (“Miral” contains anger-inducing violent themes, particularly for those sympathetic to Israel.) ' \n",

March 31 (Bloomberg) - Hennes & Mauritz AB, the world’s second-largest clothing retailer, reported first-quarter profit that fell more than analysts anticipated as the company decided against passing on higher costs to customers. Net income dropped 30 percent to 2.62 billion kronor ($420 million) in the quarter ended Feb. 28 from 3.74 billion kronor from the year-earlier period, the Stockholm-based company said in a statement today. The average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of 2.77 billion kronor. The shares fell as much as 4.4 percent. H&M’s sales dropped 1 percent in the period while larger rival Inditex SA posted a 10 percent jump in its fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. H&M, which buys its products from about 700 suppliers, has reduced prices for some items even as the price of cotton has traded near a record while some competitors have raised or maintained them. “H&M is making a massive bet on market-share gains,” Simon Irwin, an analyst at Liberum Capital in London, said by phone today. “They’re cutting prices in an environment where their costs are rising and competition is increasing.” H&M shares fell as much as 9.5 kronor to 207.10 kronor and traded at 208.40 kronor as of 12:01 p.m. The stock has dropped 6.9 percent this year, compared with larger rival Inditex’s 0.7 percent advance. Inditex runs Zara stores. The Swedish retailer’s strategy to not pass on increased sourcing costs has served it well and the strategy is “good in the longer term,” H&M Chief Executive Officer Karl-Johan Persson said at a press conference today. Trench Coat H&M sells a trench coat on its U.K. Website for 34.99 pounds ($56.44), while Zara offers one for 79.99 pounds. Inditex, which also runs Massimo Dutti and Bershka stores, gets about 65 percent of its revenue from Zara. H&M sources two-thirds of its product from Asia. Inditex gets about 35 percent of its products from there and only half of that amount comes from China, where input costs are rising the fastest, said London-based Societe Generale analyst Anne Critchlow in an e-mail. “H&M has chosen to reduce its prices in the current environment, which further hurts the gross margin,” said Critchlow, who has a sell rating on the stock. “Inditex says its prices are maintained.” H&M’s gross margin in the first quarter was 57.8 percent, compared with 61.9 percent a year earlier. Sales in February rose by 9 percent in local currencies from the same month last year and advanced 3 percent between March 1 and March 29. ‘More Robust’ “Inditex is much better-placed” than H&M, said Irwin. “Its top-line has been more robust, and given its mid-market positioning and proximity sourcing base it is less exposed to rising input prices.” H&M also said today that the three months was “characterized by continued restrained consumption, a discount- driven market with many price activities and unfavourable weather conditions,” in December when it closed some stores temporarily amid heavy snowstorms. “Sales have remained sluggish, which we think will raise concerns that H&M is confusing customers and pricing too close to discounters,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Richard Chamberlain in a note today. Inditex also plans to expand at about twice the pace of H&M, with a target of 500 new stores this year while H&M aims for 250. Inditex said on March 23 that it opened 160 stores in Asia last year, of which 75 were in China’s main and smaller cities. The Spanish retailer plans to add a further 120 Chinese stores across its eight brands in 2011. - With assistance by Janina Pfalzer in Stockholm.

In the biggest Wall Street insider trading case since the 1980s, U.S. prosecutors have persistently pressed phone tap evidence that Rajaratnam had a direct line to his friend and then Goldman Sachs director, Rajat Gupta, who leaked bank secrets to him. The trial is in its fourth week and could last until the end of April. On Wednesday, the Manhattan federal court jury heard another FBI phone tap to support government allegations Rajaratnam knew a day before it was announced in September 2008 that Goldman would receive a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway . In the phone tap of a call on Sept. 24, 2008, between Rajaratnam and his personal Galleon trader, Ian Horowitz, he is heard describing his efforts the previous day to buy shares two minutes before the 4 p.m. stock market close. \"\"I got a call at 3:58, right?\"\" Rajaratnam said, referring to the September 23 conversation with Gupta about a Goldman board meeting that day. \"\"Saying something good might happen to Goldman, right?\"\" But when he then called Galleon, the first trader he reached was unable to complete it. \"\"I, so I told Ananth to buy some, he was fucking around, he can't, you know.

The Detroit automaker said Thursday the sale was valued at $3.8 billion. GM, which spun off Delphi as a separate company in 1999, reacquired partial ownership of in the Troy-based supplier in October 2009 as it exited bankruptcy as a new firm owned mostly by former creditors. Delphi filed for bankruptcy in 2005. \"\"We are systematically delivering on our commitment to strengthen and simplify our balance sheet,\"\" said Dan Ammann, who officially becomes GM's senior vice president and chief financial officer today. The sale ends a painful period for GM, which had sought to end its ties with Delphi, only to be forced to reacquire its global steering business in 2009. It sold the business to a Chinese government firm last year. The sale doesn't change GM's day-to-day relationship with the global auto supplier. \"\"It allows GM and Delphi to have a normal automaker, supplier relationship,\"\" said GM spokesman Jim Cain. GM will report $1.6 billion in revenue from the sale in the first quarter of 2011. While GM will eventually earn $3.8 billion on the sale, it previously spent $12.5 billion to help the supplier during its bankruptcy stay. Analyst Joe Phillippi, AutoTrends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J., said the sale isn't likely to change things much for GM or the auto supplier. \"\"This is the culmination of a process that began more than 10 years ago,\"\" Phillippi said. \"\"GM is bringing in more cash and they'll pay down more debt, pure and simple.\"\" On Thursday, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. — the government's pension insurer — sold its stake in Delphi for $594 million. The move helps clear the way for Delphi's private equity owners to sell the company or take it public.

Google said two of the companies named were its units, and a third was a separate firm that works closely with Google. But Google denied the tax violations alleged in the Chinese-language Economic Daily. \"\"We believe we are, and always have been, in full compliance with Chinese tax law,\"\" Google said in a statement. Even if the report is unfounded or embellished, it could bring fresh headaches in China for Google, which has gone through difficult times there since early last year when it clashed with the government over internet censorship and hacking attacks. China generates a small percentage of Google's revenues, but is the world's largest internet market with more than 450 million users. The country's search market, dominated by homegrown Baidu Inc, was worth 11bn yuan (£1.05bn) in 2010 and is likely to grow by about 50% each year for the next four years, according to iResearch. The Economic Daily said that the three companies investigated and punished were \"\"Google enterprises in China\"\". \"\"The taxation authorities have already investigated and punished the three companies according to the law,\"\" said the report on its front page. The companies were accused of presenting false and unjustified claims to the total value of 40m yuan, said the report. It did not say when the claimed violations are alleged to have happened. \"\"It is understood by this reporter that the taxation authorities are further investigating Google businesses in China on suspicion of tax avoidance,\"\" said the brief story, which was also later reported by China's official Xinhua news agency. A Google spokesperson said the two of the accused companies - Google Information Technology (China) Co Ltd and and Google Information Technology (Shanghai) Co Ltd - were its sub-units. It said the third company named, Google Advertising (Shanghai) Co Ltd, was a separate firm which works \"\"closely with Google as Google's sole first-tier reseller in China\"\" of advertising on the search engine's web pages. \"\"Most foreign companies in China, especially high-profile companies with a global reputation at stake, are pretty careful to make sure they are in full compliance with the relevant tax laws,\"\" said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a Beijing-based company that advises investors about China's Internet and telecommunications sectors. China's foreign ministry would not comment directly about the report. \"\"Generally speaking, any companies operating abroad should obey the laws and regulations of the host country,\"\" said the ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu. The report appeared after Google again clashed with the Chinese government over internet censorship. Earlier this month, Google said any difficulty that users in China may have faced opening its email service were likely the result of government blocks. China's ruling Communist party has intensified censorship in recent months, fearing that calls for protests inspired by anti-authoritarian uprisings across the Middle East and north Africa could gather momentum. Google's serious run-ins with the Chinese government began in January 2010, when the company said it was no longer willing to censor search results in the country. Previously, the company included a disclaimer on its China service that searches may not be complete because of local laws. ' \n",

The unnamed German national was arrested in Cologne on Tuesday after allegedly placing the explosives in a parking garage near the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund, home of the Borussia Dortmund team, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation told The Local news agency. The bombs were safely defused, and three more were found at the man's home in Krefeld, officials said. Investigators said they began tracking the man after he e-mailed the German Embassy in Pakistan, offering information about two planned attacks in Germany by a group. The warning appeared to be a blackmail bid and was worded like an unsolved attempted blackmail case last year. \"\"The suspect apparently acted alone with a general criminal motive,\"\" a federal spokesman said. \"\"There are absolutely no ties to terrorist or Islamist organizations.\"\" Authorities say he admitted placing the bombs. Dortmund police spokesman Michael Stein told the BBC: \"\"We expect no security threat at all for the upcoming Bundesliga match on Saturday. Visitors are invited to come to Dortmund. They will be safe here.\"\" ' \n",

But it's not all Patagonia and lattes out there, as the news yesterday about the Justice Department's investigation of Seattle police would indicate. The DOJ is looking into a possible pattern of the SPD using excessive force and discriminating against minorities, Justice announced here yesterday. At issue in the federal investigation are several high-profile incidents involving police violence. Last April, a detective was videotaped kicking a Latino robbery suspect and stating that he would beat the \"\"Mexican piss\"\" out of the suspect; In June, an officer was videotaped punching a 17-year-old African American girl who protested the arrest of a friend for jaywalking; and, In August, police shot a Native American woodcarver after he faied to drop his carving knife. (Click here for a Seattle Post-Intelligencer article on the investigation and here's one from the LA Times.) Seattle Police Chief John Diaz told the Seattle Times that he welcomes the DOJ investigation and considers it like a \"\"free audit.\"\" \"\"We have nothing to hide,\"\" he said. \"\"We've been open and transparent with the Department of Justice, which makes for a good working relationship.\"\" On a separate and lighter note, we would like to point out that our own Ashby Jones, who currently is on vacation, has first-hand experience with the mean streets of Seattle. Earlier this year, Jones followed modern-day superhero Phoenix Jones (pictured below), as Phoenix patrolled Seattle in a black-and-gold costume in search of drug dealers and other miscreants.

Dirar Abu Sisi, suspected of links with Hamas, vanished from a train near Kiev on February 19, allegedly kidnapped by Mossad. Dirar Abu Sisi appeared in court on Thursday for a hearing on extending his detention. Prosecutors asked the court to allow the Palestinian to be held for five more days after which he would be officially charged. At this stage, the story seems to have more questions than answers. The Palestinian engineer went missing while traveling from the Ukrainian city of Kharkov to Kiev. Two men reportedly walked into his compartment, produced IDs of special services officers and removed him from the train. A sequence of mysterious events then unfolded, confusing not only the family of the kidnapped engineer and the media, but even the Ukrainian officials. Some reported that he turned up at the Israeli prison the next day after he had been abducted; later a number of media reported the same information but only on March 10. Israeli authorities officially confirmed this report on March 20, when the Israeli court bowed to human rights activists and admitted that Sisi was being kept in jail in Israel, according to Itar-Tass news agency. Finally, the situation became more or less clear when the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu openly admitted on Thursday that the man had indeed been kept in prison in Israel saying: \"\"Abu Sisi is a Hamas member. He is being held in Israel. He supplied us with valuable information.\"\" But Netanyahu did not elaborate. Abu Sisi's alleged connection to Hamas was named by the media, almost straight away, as one of the reasons for such drastic actions. However, both he and his Ukrainian wife Veronika deny all allegations. Moreover, Veronika appealed to the UN High Commission for Refugees to address the issue. She believes that the kidnapping was performed by the Israeli intelligence service, Mossad. \"\"How can I explain to my children that their father wasn't killed by a bomb in Palestine but disappeared from a train in a democratic country?\"\" she told Ukraine's Kyiv Post. According to Abu Sisi's account that he gave to the lawyer who was allowed to visit him in jail - from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCRH), a Gaza-based NGO - the people who abducted him on the train wore Ukrainian military uniform, they took his documents by force, then removed him from the train and drove him to Kiev. He says he was held and interrogated in an apartment by individuals who identified themselves as members of Mossad. Another reason for such actions, as speculated by the Israeli media, is Sisi's possible connection to the kidnapping of an Israeli Defense Forces soldier, Gilad Schalit, and the belief that Sisi knows his current whereabouts. Noam Shalit, the father of abducted IDF soldier, even called on the family of the detained Palestinian engineer on Thursday to pressure Hamas to reach a deal that would bring about the release of his son, reports Israeli Haaretz newspaper. After appearing in court on Thursday, Abu Sisi, when asked, told the press: \"\"I don't know anything about Gilad Shalit. I don't know anything. I'm an engineer,\"\" as quoted by The Guardian. According to the Jerusalem Post's report on Friday, when asked about the possibility of Sisi being exchanged for Schalit, prime minister Netanyahu declined to comment. However, Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, in an interview to Israel Army radio said that: \"\"He didn't organize the abduction or guard Schalit but he is a person with intimate internal information on Hamas.\"\" What seems to be particularly intriguing in the whole story is how exactly the engineer was removed from Ukraine. RT spoke to a former security officer in the country who said that in case of a planned operation between the two countries' intelligence services, the man would simply be arrested quietly and deported. In this case, however, both the Ukrainian intelligence and the Interior Ministry have said they had no idea of such a plan by their Israeli counterparts. Moreover, Ukraine's Interior Minister, Aleksandr Mogilyov, is set to visit Israel, to try to find out more details behind the operation, which the Ukrainian side claims it was not notified about. The unfolding story, a thriller of its kind, is not the first time that Israeli intelligence has undertaken such acts. In January 2010, a man believed to be connected to the Hamas terrorist cell, was assassinated in a hotel in Dubai. Eleven men with fake French, Irish and other passports were put on the international wanted list by the UAE. However, that story seems far from being resolved, despite the fact that Israel did not deny Mossad's involvement. ' \n",

Former NOPD Officer Warren was sentenced to 25 years and nine months in prison for his involvement in the Sept. 2, 2005, shooting death of civilian Henry Glover. As part of the restitution order, Warren will also pay $7,642.32 to Glover's family for funeral expenses. Warren was found guilty by a federal jury of a civil rights violation resulting in death for shooting Glover, and for using a firearm to commit manslaughter. Current NOPD Officer McRae was sentenced to 17 years and three months in prison, three years of supervised release, and restitution in the amount of $6,000 for his involvement in the burning of Mr. Glover's body. McRae was convicted of two civil rights violations, one count of obstructing justice, and one count of using fire during the commission of a felony. One of the civil rights counts charged that McRae willfully used fire to destroy a civilian's property by burning and destroying a car, and the other civil rights count charged that he willfully deprived Glover's family members of their right to seek redress in the courts for his death. Evidence presented at trial established that Warren, while stationed on a second floor lookout, shot Glover, who was a floor below him and running away. Glover's brother and a friend flagged down a passing motorist, \"\"Good Samaritan\"\" William Tanner, who put the wounded Glover in his car to try to get medical attention for him. However, when the group of men drove up to a makeshift police station seeking help for Glover, police officers surrounded the men at gunpoint, handcuffed them and let Glover die in the back seat of the car. McRae then drove off with Tanner's car, with Glover's body inside, and burned both the body and the car with a traffic flare. Advertisement This case was investigated by the New Orleans Field Office of the FBI and was prosecuted by Trial Attorney Jared Fishman, of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Tracey Knight and Michael Magner for the Eastern District of Louisiana.

John Edwards spent several hours Thursday re-interviewing the man who posed as the father of Edwards' out-of-wedlock baby during the 2008 presidential campaign. Andrew Young met with the prosecutors in his attorney's Washington office for more than four hours. The Associated Press spotted him leaving the building's underground garage in a vehicle with a North Carolina license plate registered to his wife, Cheri, at their home in Chapel Hill. The interview is particularly notable because of its timing. Young has already been questioned by a grand jury investigating Edwards in 2009, and the Justice Department is considering whether to move forward with an indictment. The prosecutors could be interested in taking a closer look at Young to see how he'll hold up as a witness, since his credibility could be problematic. Young, who was an aide to Edwards' 2008 presidential campaign, initially claimed he was the father of the child and traveled around the country helping keep Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, hidden. Young has since come out with a book detailing his role in covering up Edwards' paternity of the baby. Young now says he made a mistake in judgment by lying. His book is being turned into a Hollywood film. Edwards acknowledged in January 2010 that he fathered the girl, Frances Quinn Hunter. Last year, a North Carolina judge said he was troubled by a series of seemingly conflicting statements that Young made under oath in a lawsuit over a purported sex tape depicting Edwards. Superior Court Judge Abraham Penn Jones considered sending Young to jail for contempt but backed away as Young's attorneys argued that the discrepancies were memory lapses. Young has said he had the sex tape simply to corroborate his story. Young's attorney, David Geneson, did not return a call for comment on the meeting, and the Justice Department declined to comment. The investigation centers on the money spent to keep Hunter and Young in hiding. Investigators are looking chiefly at whether money paid to Hunter and Young - from outside political groups and Edwards' political donors - should have been considered campaign donations since the money arguably aided his presidential bid. Young would be the chief witness, since one donor who gave them money has died and the second is 100 years old. Haunted by other case The investigation is being jointly run by the Republican-appointed U.S. attorney in Raleigh and the public integrity section of Justice Department in Washington. The Justice Department has reason to be cautious in pursuing the case after the public integrity section's last prosecution of a high-profile politician, the late Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, ended so badly. A judge overturned Stevens' conviction and ordered a criminal investigation into the prosecutors' conduct after the department admitted its lawyers did not turn over important, exculpatory evidence to the defense team. Associated Press writer Mike Baker in Raleigh contributed to this report. ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'New Life for the Art of Lace-Making The Return of Lace as a Major Fashion Trend is Giving a Boost to a Once-Faltering European Business Caudry, France Lace, suddenly, is everywhere. Looking nothing like your grandmother's doilies, lace is the fabric of whole dresses and suits for summer, as well as next fall. Lace hasn't been this popular since Queen Victoria sat on the throne. The lavish lace is a dramatic change—not only for high fashion but also for a European industry that has been dwindling since the 1920s. Europe was once famous for lace—hundreds of types of Swiss, Belgian, French and at one point even English lace. Now, much of the lace shown on high-end runways comes from one town in northeastern France. The French lace industry was famous when Jerry Lee Lewis crooned, \"\"Chantilly lace and a pretty face....\"\" in the 1950s. But Chantilly lace is no longer made in the French town of Chantilly. The high-end lace industry has mostly shrunk to the area around a town called Caudry, where rival companies Sophie Hallette and Solstiss supply the likes of Christian Dior, Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier, Jason Wu and Valentino. The region is known for its stinky Maroilles cheese and the slurry of its \"\"Ch'tis\"\" dialect, made famous in France by the 2008 comedy \"\"Bienvenue Chez Les Ch'tis\"\" or \"\"Welcome to the Sticks.\"\" The factories here specialize in \"\"Leavers\"\" lace, using looms that imitate the intricate knotting of 18th-century handmade lace. These machine looms, named after the Englishman who invented them, can work cotton, silk, rayon, polyester, wool or other materials into exquisite laces that are sturdier than they look. (Handmade lace is now a hobbyist's product, though some machine lace is embellished by hand.) Of course, the Leavers machines are far slower than the knitting machines now used to make mass-market lace in China. Heidi Cho, who trades in lace at Victorian Lace & Trim, a Los Angeles-based lace wholesaler, sells large quantities of Chinese lace to fast-fashion and budget-clothing manufacturers in the U.S. \"\"The China quality is low, but the price is low, Ms. Cho says. Created with an entirely different technique, it isn't nearly as nuanced or beautiful. Still, Chinese factories haven't made headway into the market for couture-level lace—largely because new Leavers machines haven't been manufactured in decades. Outside of bridal trims and lingerie, lace hasn't been a big part of women's wardrobes in recent decades. Perhaps that's partly because it's so truly, almost wholly feminine—in an era when women have been focused on competing with men. The fashion industry's most contrarian designer, Miuccia Prada, prepared the way for lace's comeback. For fall 2008, she used heavy Swiss-made lace—a type more often used in curtains—in Prada's skirts, dresses and accessories. French lace makers celebrated, knowing Prada was likely to influence other designers. Sophie Hallette's U.S. sales representative, Jane Pincus, recalls that she was at a Paris fabric trade show in the spring of 2008 when word spread about the huge Prada order. \"\"There was champagne popping in the booth,\"\" she says. \"\"The sheer size—they put it on every product—the shoes, the bags.\"\" Then the financial crisis hit, with Lehman Brothers collapsing in September. Many designers stripped expensive details from their collections to slash prices. In late 2009, Don O'Neill, designer of the midpriced Theia line, used a wedge of Sophie Hallette lace at the neck of a gown that was priced for retail at $450. He says one U.S. luxury retailer asked him to use cheaper Chinese lace to bring the price of the dress closer to $350. The French lace cost $22.33 per yard, compared with $2 or $3 per yard for lace from China, he says. This wasn't the most expensive lace—in fact, the average wholesale price of Sophie Hallette lace is about $63 a yard, says Maud Lescroart, the company's head of marketing. At retail, a garment is often priced at five or six times what it cost the designer to make, after markups by the brand, the retailer and sometimes middlemen. So $20 of lace can raise the ultimate price of a dress by $100. \"\"They didn't understand why I wouldn't just put Chinese lace on it,\"\" says Mr. O'Neill, who refused to switch laces. Not every designer made the same decision. During the financial crisis, Sophie Hallette, which also owns the Riechers Marescot lace brand, laid off 25% of its work force in Caudry—a painful time for the family-owned company. Now, as the world economy sputters along in recovery mode, lace has a fresh new appeal for designers. Indeed, European couture lace provides a near-perfect metaphor for what's going on in the luxury market, where designers have been rethinking classic materials from mink to pearls. Lace is expensive and utterly traditional, yet it's being put to use in a modern, whole-hog way, such as a hoop-shaped lace skirt from Yohji Yamamoto or Valentino's winter coat with lace stitched over a more substantial fabric. Some of the machines in action at the Sophie Hallette factory in Caudry are 100 years old, says Ms. Lescroart, who is the 38-year-old granddaughter of the company's founder. Many jobs are inherited from parents. Eric Lernon operates a tulle loom that his father worked on as a tulliste . \"\"It's like a 19th-century company in the 21st century,\"\" Ms. Lescroart says, glancing around the factory floor where she spent a good deal of her childhood. In a showroom, she and creative director Pierre Alain Cornaz pull out lace trims so complex that it takes a person two days to make one meter. Often details such as embroidery, sequins and other embellishments are added by hand. New lace patterns from Mr. Cornaz are drawn by hand—every single thread —by a team at the factory. The lace patterns they were drawing in February 2011 will be seen on runways more than a year later, in September 2012, and the clothes will hit stores in January of 2013. Threading the tulle loom takes two months and two people, says Ms. Lescroart. \"\"Tell the designers that's why it takes so long to fill their orders,\"\" she jokes. In another room, women mend tiny faults by hand, holding the lace on their laps. \"\"This is a woman's room,\"\" says Ms. Lescroart. \"\"It takes patience.\"\" Down a hallway in a laboratory, chemist Philippe Desmaretz measures dyes in beakers and vials. \"\"He's got a lot of work now because of the shows,\"\" Ms. Lescroart says. \"\"All the designers want special colors.\"\" —Contact me at Christina.Binkley@wsj.com or twitter.com/BinkleyOnStyle.

But Kate Moss has decided to pay tribute to the late designer the best way she knows how - by wearing one of his most iconic creations. The 37-year-old poses in McQueen's ethereal \"\"hologram\"\" organza dress, which she famously wore for his Autumn/Winter 2006 fashion show five years ago, for a new magazine shoot. Enlarge A hologram of Moss flailing around like a ghostly apparition appeared on stage at the climax of the March 2006 show at Paris Fashion Week. McQueen projected the image on the stage in tribute to Moss, who was then lying low after being caught in a cocaine scandal six months earlier. And the supermodel was given the chance to return the favour in the new issue of Harper's Bazaar magazine. On the cover of the glossy, Moss also wears a white McQueen creation by the label's head designer Sarah Burton, who took over from Lee McQueen after his death. Of the late designer, who committed suicide in February last year, Kate says: \"\"There’s never ever going to be anybody like him. She recalls first meeting McQueen. ‘It was all a bit of a blur - I was doing a lot of shows at the time. \"\"I can’t even remember the first show I did for him, but I remember the first show he did in New York. It was raining, everyone was outside, and I said, “Lee, you’ve got to get Anna Wintour in!” He didn’t care. It was all chaos.’ \"\"His was the most exciting show to see ever, even if you weren’t there. I would hear about it on the phone and hear Lee and hear everyone. \"\"There was so much tension, but we had the best laughs. He was a dear friend of mine. I miss him terribly.\"\" Kate discusses clothes the late designer gave her during their friendship in the interview. ‘There are a few he gave me before he died,\"\" she says. \"\"I went to give him his Christmas present and he gave me a lot of stuff. He was saying, “You’ve got to have this.” \"\"He gave me a black dress and a fur that I wore to his funeral. Before the funeral, I was going through my wardrobe thinking, “What am I going to wear?” It’s weird, now that I think about it - almost like he kind of knew.’ The man dubbed the wild child of British fashion, \"\"gave women power\"\", the supermodel insists, \"\"while letting them be fragile and vulnerable at the same time. \"\"People always used to say he was a misogynist, but it took me a while to realise that he was actually empowering women and not the other way around.\"\" There is almost as much speculation surrounding who will create Kate's wedding gown as there is for the \"\"Other Kate\"\". She is rumoured to have ditched plans for her friend John Galliano to design the bridal dress after he was fired from Christian Dior in disgrace over his alleged anti-Semitic outburst in Paris last month. Kate Halfpenny, who dressed Kate in a vintage gown for her 35th birthday party, is another name being circulated. Miss Moss is currently in Hong Kong, to open a flagship Longchamp store.

We're constantly on the lookout for weird and wonderful stories in the the weird and wonderful world of fashion, so our patent-pending Weirdar gave a resounding \"\"beep!\"\" when we heard the news that Jean Paul Gaultier is to be the subject of an exhibition in Canada. What's so weird about that, you ask? Well, he's also going to be part of an experiment to turn him into a talking head. Pencils out ... aaaand tick the \"\"weird\"\" box! Before you get too excited, FS must break the news that this is, alas, not some sort of twisted real-life version of that comedy classic The Man with Two Brains, or indeed, as a quick Twitter inquiry for \"\"films with talking heads\"\" reminded us, a re-make of the scene in Return to Oz where Dorothy steals the powder of life from Princess Mombi (watch it - it's scary). We must turn to the new exhibition, \"\"The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier: From the Sidewalk to the Catwalk\"\", to find out what's really going on. \"\"We moulded the head of Jean Paul in plaster and we will have [film] projections right onto the face,\"\" explains Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the curator of the exhibition. Oh. FS is disappointed. However, we reckon the exhibition will be fun even without decapitation. There will be 120 iconic outfits on display and a variety of talking plaster heads modelled on Gaultier's celebrity clients (what will the Kate Moss one say?). They'll also show some of Gaultier's early fashion sketches, Polaroids by Andy Warhol, and incontrovertible proof that JPG was a child prodigy. This comes in the form of an augmented teddy bear upon which the young designer affixed a crafted paper pointy bosom. We can't wait. The exhibition opens at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Montréal in Canada on June 17. BANG ON TREND Whistles' \"\"Carrie\"\" skirt, New Look's purple pumps, and Dorothy Perkins' orange dress/ Colour blocking Tangerine, lime and lemon. No, FS is not suffering from scurvy, we're talking about fashionable colours. Bright, bold colour blocking is one of the trends we have deemed to be \"\"actual fun\"\" and there's no need to stick to citrus. Mix and (mis)match scarlet, violet, and sky-blue, too. One of the nice things about colour blocking is that it's quite easy to do and you can take it as far as you want. If you're just after a shot of colour to add va-va-voom to a plain outfit then there are plenty of great accessories at the moment. Take, for instance, Asos's hot pink clutch (currently £16) which would look great matched with an orange dress like this one from Dorothy Perkins (£35). French Connection's cross-body bag is satchel-like, gorgeous and a sunny shade of tangerine (£165), and on the other end of the price scale we've found a blue skinny belt for a mere £4 from fashionunion.co.uk. If you're after shoes then purple brogues will help to brighten your day - these Asos suede ones are fabulous (£35). Need shoes for a jazzier occasion? Then try New Look's purple court shoe with a platform sole (£19.99). Alternatively, River Island are stocking a nice line in red and yellow patent slingbacks with a kitten heel (£39.99). Skirt-wearers should watch out for spring's new maxi lengths - they're perfect for colour blocking. Reiss's \"\"Danielle\"\" version costs £100 (ouch) and is suitably voluminous whether you buy it in green or vermillion. Then there's the infamous (and rapidly becoming ubiquitous) coral \"\"Carrie\"\" pleated skirt from Whistles. At £95 it's what Grazia would call an investment piece (or FS would call expensive) and you might want to try out wearing the new lengths (knee-length and midi) before you decide it's for you. Zara have some great trousers available in a rainbow of colours from apple green to acid yellow. They're all around the £40 mark and we'll just provide you with a link to the skinny pair as we particularly like the way they're styled in the model's picture.

That’s good news for LVMH, which commissioned Frank Gehry to design the building–formally known as the Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation–in 2006, at a cost of $200 million. The museum will hold Arnault’s vast corporate and private collections of art, including 20th-century classics from Picasso, Yves Klein, Henry Moore and Andy Warhol mixed with modern work by Agnes Martin, Frank Serra, Jeff Koons and Pierre Huyghe. Earlier this year, the administrative tribunal of Paris, a part of the national judiciary system, had revoked the center's building permit citing its apparent encroachment on the Jardin d’Acclimatation, a childrens park next to the building site. Opponents to the site had also complained that a new building would disrupt the verdant peace of the historic park. Christophe Girard, the deputy mayor in charge of culture of the city of Paris and the director of marketing strategy for the fashion sector of LVMH, filed and won an appeal. Gehry, for his part, told reporters he was “distressed, shocked and furious” at the threat to his “magical” creation. His spokesman criticized the “selfishness, lack of civic pride and ignorance” of the groups opposing the building and predicted that in a few years it will be considered “a national monument.” Located in the center of the Bois de Boulogne, the giant glass-encased structure will look like an iceberg dressed in a cloud,” according to Arnault’s cultural adviser, Jean-Paul Claverie. Gehry has said the translucent panels are positioned to reflect different colors and light patterns throughout the day. Mostly though the complex (it includes a restaurant and auditorium) will demonstrate Arnault’s role as the penultimate tastemaker and LVMH as an institution devoted to fostering high culture in France and abroad. The Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation is set to open in late 2012. Follow me on Twitter: @HannahElliott ' \n",

Hustler faces $14,175 in fines for three violations, including failure to provide condoms or other protective equipment, according to a Division of Occupational Safety and Health citation provided to The Associated Press Wednesday. Hustler \"\"failed to ensure the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, such as condoms\"\" to protect its employees from semen, vaginal excretions and blood in the course of producing adult videos, according to the citation. The current fines are based on the same section of state law that also requires hospitals to provide nurses with protective gear to spare them exposure to blood-borne and fluid-borne illnesses. Flynt has said in the past that audiences don't want to watch porn in which actors use condoms. Hustler was also fined for failing to maintain a written injury and illness policies and for failing to provide workers with vaccines for hepatitis C. Hustler's citation stems from a Sept. 14 inspection of a jobs site in response to a complaint from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit that advocates for safe sex in pornography. Forsaken Pictures faces $12,150 in fines for similar violations. The fines were issued March 9. Cal/OSHA Senior Safety Engineer Deborah Gold said the state continually investigates the porn industry, though job sites can be difficult to find, and has cited a handful of producers for violations in recent years. \"\"Clearly if an employee is having unprotected sexual contact with another person then there needs to be either engineering control, like simulation, or people need to use a condom or other barrier,\"\" Gold said. A telephone message seeking comment left by The Associated Press wasn't immediately returned by a Hustler representative. Contact information for Forsaken couldn't be located. Late last year, a porn actor tested positive for HIV at a California clinic, causing panic among actors. Some San Fernando Valley pornographers in the multibillion-dollar adult entertainment industry shuttered productions as a precaution. ' \n",

Tili is a crowd pleaser because his sheer size allows him to soak the crowds very effectively as he swims by to chants of \"\"Shamu! Shamu!\"\" The park is debuting a new orca show, One Ocean, in late April, which will no doubt draw even more people. So how do you see the orca show at SeaWorld most effectively? Here are some tips: 1) Arrive at Shamu Stadium early. The stadium opens about half an hour before show time, although people line up before that on the busiest days. There are refreshment stands and restrooms at the stadium, so you can get munchies, souvenirs and drinks or make a quick pitstop once you get there. The stadium is massive, so it only reaches capacity on the busiest days, but you won't have a good seat choice if you get there late. 2) Choose your entrance carefully. There are multiple entrances to Shamu Stadium, so don't just jump into the first line you see on a crowded day. Walk around the stadium and see if you can find something shorter. 3) Be prepared if you sit in the soak section. You really do get wet in the danger zone, especially now that Tili is back. Splashing is a big crowd pleasure, so it's likely to be part of the new show, too. Wear a poncho if you don't want to get your clothes wet, and stash fragile items like cameras and cell phone in plastic bags to protect them. Ride Atlantis, the park's water ride, after sitting in the soak zone since you are already wet, or ride it before the show. Advertisement 4) Don't rush out at the end. People tend to jump up and hurry to the exits once the show is over. Rather than fighting the crowd, I like to relax for a bit. Sometimes the trainers are around at the end, so you can have a nice chat with them until the massive pack of people is gone. Click here to see a video of Tili's first return performance.

But for the first time in 10 years, the outlook is improving for new retirees wondering whether they'll be able to pay their medical bills throughout their retirements. A 65-year-old couple retiring this year will need $230,000, on average, to cover medical expenses in retirement, according to a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments. That's down 8 percent from the $250,000 projection the Boston-based financial services company made a year ago. That's notable because the total had risen each year since Fidelity made its initial calculation of $160,000 in 2002. Annual increases have averaged 6 percent. Fidelity attributes its optimism to President Obama's year-old health care overhaul, which will reduce many seniors' out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs. The projections are part of Fidelity's business helping employers design workplace benefits programs. The study is based on projections for a couple of 65-year-olds retiring this year with Medicare coverage. The estimate factors in the federal program's premiums, co-payments and deductibles, as well as out-of-pocket prescription costs. The study assumes no employer provided insurance in retirement, and a life expectancy of 85 for women and 82 for men. The calculation was complicated this year by the health care bill that Obama signed into law in March 2010. Although its focus is expanding health care access to people under age 65, the law also will benefit many retirees by gradually closing what's known as the \"\"doughnut hole\"\" coverage gap in the Medicare drug benefit. Fidelity says that's the key reason why its projection is down this year. But that effect will run its course. Longer-term, retirees' cost savings aren't expected to offset other factors driving expenses up, such as new medical technologies, greater use of health care services, and more diagnostic tests. That's why Fidelity expects its calculation will eventually resume its historic pattern of annual increases. \"\"We expect that trend to continue when we look to 2012 and beyond,\"\" said Sunit Patel, a senior vice president for benefits consulting at Fidelity. Fidelity's estimate is a projection of what an average couple would need. Actual costs will vary widely, depending on a couple's medical needs and how long they live. The projection also doesn't factor in most dental services, or long-term care, such as costs from living in a nursing home. In any given year, about one in four Medicare beneficiaries have drug expenses high enough to hit the doughnut hole, in which they're responsible for the full cost of their medications. The older one gets, the greater the chances of landing in that hole at some point because of an illness requiring costly prescription drugs. For 2011, the coverage gap starts after Medicare beneficiaries and their insurance plan have spent $2,840 on medications. After that, seniors are responsible for roughly the next $3,600. Once total spending reaches about $6,440, Medicare's catastrophic coverage kicks in and beneficiaries pay only a small amount. Under the new law, the gap will be gradually eliminated by 2020. When the changes are complete, seniors will just pay the regular 25 percent cost sharing for all their medications. The Employee Benefit Research Institute, an independent nonprofit, conducts similar research but, unlike Fidelity, doesn't focus on an average. That's because there are so many variables that impact a retiree's circumstances, says Paul Fronstin, EBRI's director of health research and education. In its latest annual estimate released in November, EBRI projected that a couple with median drug expenses - meaning half of the population would have higher, and half lower - would need $158,000 for a 50 percent chance of having saved enough to cover health care expenses in retirement. They'd need $271,000 for a 90 percent chance. EBRI's study didn't closely examine the savings impact from the health care law because of differences in how it makes its projections compared with Fidelity. Advertisement ' \n",

In addition to that, it says that if all else fails, and the Senate brings about a shutdown, then members should not get their pay.” That’s House Majority Leader Eric Cantor describing his “Government Shutdown Prevention Act.” The problem is, this would be blatantly unconstitutional: The Senate needs to pass the same piece of legislation the House does, and the president needs to either sign it or have his veto overturned.

In a long-term study of more than 600,000 cancer survivors, an estimated 8 percent of second cancers were attributable to radiation treatment for the original cancer, according to the study. The results suggest that other factors, such as lifestyle risks and genetics, cause the majority of second cancers, the researchers say. \"\"The findings can be used by physicians to really put the risks into perspective when they are talking treatment options with their patients,\"\" said lead researcher Amy Berrington de Gonzalez, an investigator in the NCI's radiation epidemiology branch. Patients should feel reassured, she added. \"\"In general, the risks [of radiation therapy] are smaller than the benefits,\"\" she said. The study, published online March 30 in The Lancet Oncology , is the first to quantify the cancer risks posed by radiation treatment for different malignancies. Berrington de Gonzalez and colleagues collected data on 647,672 adult cancer survivors included in the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results cancer registries. All had survived five years or longer after cancer treatment, and follow-up ran from 1978 to 2007. The researchers looked at outcomes for 15 different types of cancer for which radiation treatment is routine, including cancers of the rectum, larynx, lung, breast, cervix, testicles, prostate, eye and orbit, brain and thyroid. Over the 30 years of follow-up, 9 percent of these participants developed a second cancer. Of these, about 3,300 (8 percent) might have been the result of radiation treatment, the study authors said. Second cancers related to earlier radiation therapy varied by type, the researchers noted. More than half of the second cancers developed in breast and prostate cancer survivors. Four percent of second cancers were in the eye, and 24 percent were cancer of the testicles, the researchers found. Patients who had their initial cancer when young were at the greatest risk of developing a second cancer. Also at high risk were those whose organs received high doses of radiation. The likelihood of developing a secondary cancer increased over time. When these data are put in perspective, the absolute risk for a second cancer is 3 in 1,000 over 10 years after radiation therapy and 5 in 1,000 over 15 years, Berrington de Gonzalez said. \"\"We know that radiation therapy can increase the risk of getting another cancer, but at the same time the benefits outweigh the risks,\"\" said Elizabeth Ward, national vice president for intramural research at the American Cancer Society. Radiation therapy is an important and relatively safe treatment for cancer, she added. Thanks to treatment advances, Ward said, radiologists today are better able to pinpoint treatment and limit exposure to healthy tissue than they were in the past. Now, studies are needed to determine the cancer risks from newer radiation treatments, the authors noted. Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, agreed that the NCI findings are encouraging. \"\"Despite people's concerns, radiation is relatively safe with regard to the issue of second cancers, because the number of cancers that result from it are very small,\"\" D'Amico said.

The former chief technology officer of Microsoft is an executive at DreamWorks Animation, once studied with Stephen Hawking and donated Tyrannosaurus rex fossils he uncovered in Montana to the Smithsonian. He was profiled by Malcolm Gladwell, is a pal of Bill Gates and spent the last several years working on \"\"Modernist Cuisine,\"\" an encyclopedic six-volume compendium of cutting-edge cooking that is not only one of the most expensive cookbooks ever published (the list price is $625, though it's available on Amazon.com for a mere $461.62) but also one of the heaviest, a fire-door-stopper that tips the scales at more than 40 pounds. An initial print run of 6,000 editions has already sold out. Even more exciting for baristas and home brewers, there's an entire chapter on coffee, 50 thick pages devoted to the topic. In culinary circles coffee is often a second-class subject, not worth the ink. In \"\"Modernist Cuisine\"\" it's treated seriously, and takes its place right next to a section on wine. The chapter is essentially a detailed primer. It outlines how coffee is processed, stored and roasted, and discusses the best grinders (conical burr) and the best temperature for drinking (not scalding hot). \"\"Modernist Cuisine\"\" has a boys-with-toys current running through it, so most of the chapter is devoted to espresso and assumes that you have access to a professional or prosumer machine and dream of pulling the perfect shot. I could almost see Mark Prince nodding in approval from across the continent. There's no knocking the meticulous research that went into the chapter (there's a lucid explanation of how coffee is extracted), the conclusions (darker roasts don't mean stronger coffee) or the overall sensibility (Myhrvold is right, restaurant coffee should be better), but there isn't anything new here for the coffee nut. If you read Tim Wendelboe or Scott Rao, check in with Matt Buchanan at Gizmodo or James Hoffmann at jimseven, or even let yourself meander into a conversation with a chatty barista - you'll already be familiar with much of what's in the chapter, if not all of it. It's a shame, because \"\"Modernist Cuisine\"\" is quickly becoming known for educating the educated, either by systematizing techniques (in his review for The New York Times, Michael Rhulman writes: \"\"The table for custard lets you pick your desired consistency based on what percentage of egg you use and the temperature you cook it to, to create a thick Anglaise-style sauce or a stand-alone custard. I tested it, it's brilliant, I'll use it forever.\"\") or by explaining the arcane (John Lancaster of The New Yorker seemed fascinated to learn that because water boils at a higher temperature in New York City than in Mexico City, ovens effectively bake at higher temperatures in New York City than in Mexico City). Too bad Myhrvold doesn't do either with coffee. The espresso how-to won't hold any surprises for somebody who watches a professional at work, never mind the curious customer who takes an hour-long class at the local coffee shop. The book doesn't even have a single photo of coffee gear sliced open with an abrasive water-jet cutter. (The cross-section of a flaming grill in action has become an iconic image from the book.) There's a Synesso espresso machine with the front plate removed, but that's too easy. Maybe that's the point. If the chapter won't blow any minds within coffee, it might indoctrinate a generation of chefs and home cooks who never spent much time thinking about grinders or roast profiles. This probably won't sit well with Myhrvold, who can't handle qualified praise. So instead of fixating on shortcomings, I'll spend a moment with something he does well: express his fanatical love of espresso. In a short passage he recalls confronting his skepticism of the so-called \"\"God shot,\"\" an espresso so transcendent that it changes your life. Myhrvold writes: Then one day at the Coffee Fest trade show in Seattle, a barista named Daniel Humphries of Victrola Coffee pulled me a shot of their Streamline roast in one of the earliest Synesso machines. \"\"It was like nothing else I have ever tasted, a phenomenal and complex layering of flavors. Yes, it was coffee, but with a richness and complexity unlike those of any coffee I'd had before - unlike anything else I'd ever tasted, for that matter. … I walked around the rest of the day haunted by that taste; it was with me for hours. \"\"I'd had my first God shot. \"\"Of course now I feel foolish for doubting that God shots exist. Yes, the language used by coffee lovers to describe them is over the top, but that's because the experience itself is, too.\"\" Preach it, brother. ' \n",

The study appears in the March 30 online edition of the prestigious scientific journal Nature. The study found that a dye, used in laboratories to detect Alzheimer's disease, extended the life span of nematode worms by more than 50 percent and slowed the disease process in worms bred to mimic aspects of Alzheimer's disease. The dye is also known as Thioflavin T. Nematodes make excellent subjects for research on aging. Researchers don't have to wait long for results because the tiny worms live only two or three weeks normally, and the nematodes' genetic code has been mapped. It was research on nematodes more than two decades ago that first revealed to scientists that the aging process could be extended via genetic mutations. It had long been believed that aging was an uncontrollable process of deterioration that couldn't be altered by single genes. Since then, researchers at the Buck Institute and elsewhere have identified hundreds of genes that affect the life span of nematodes as well as compounds that can trigger the anti-aging effect. Until now, however, scientists didn't know the mechanism at work. \"\"What's new and exciting about this study is we think we know what is going on,\"\" said Gordon Lithgow, the Buck faculty member who led the research study. The study highlights a process called protein homeostasis, the ability of an organism to maintain the proper structure and balance of its proteins, which are the building blocks of life. \"\"Proteins have a certain three-dimensional shape and if that shape is lost by clumping or other types of damage their function is lost as well,\"\" Lithgow said. \"\"This is well studied in relation to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other diseases.\"\" While many degenerative diseases have been linked to a breakdown in the process, genetic studies have long indicated that protein homeostasis is a major contributor to longevity in complex animals. \"\"We've had a hunch for a long time that protein homeostasis would be a driving factor for normal aging, and I think that's what we're seeing here,\"\" Lithgow said of the study. \"\"Somehow these compounds slow the clumping of the proteins together and consequently that slows down normal aging. \"\"We have been looking for compounds that slow aging for more than 10 years and Thioflavin T is the best we have so far,\"\" Lithgow said. Aided by a $1.7 million grant from the Petaluma-based Larry L. Hillblom Foundation in 2007, Buck Institute scientists tested 120,000 chemical compounds on yeast and nematode worms in search of compounds that would slow the aging process. But Thioflavin T was not part of that process, Lithgow said. Testing Thioflavin T was the idea of Silvestre Alavez, a staff scientist in the Lithgow lab. Alavez was trained in neuroscience and knew about the use of these compounds to detect disease-related proteins. Several other compounds he identified have also proven effective in increasing life span in worms. One of those is curcumin, the active ingredient in the popular Indian spice turmeric. \"\"People have been making claims about the health benefits of curcumin for many years,\"\" Alavez said. \"\"Maybe slowing aging is part of the mechanism of action.\"\" Curcumin is being tested in several human clinical trials for conditions ranging from colon cancer to rheumatoid arthritis to depression. Alavez said, \"\"Any small molecule that maintains protein homeostasis during aging could be active against multiple disease states.\"\" Follow-up research on Thioflavin T is underway at the Buck Institute in mice bred to have Alzheimer's. One of the members of the research team that worked on the study was David Zucker, 23, a Dominican University student who is working on his master's degree. Zucker's ambition is to become a physician and he is in the process of sending out applications to medical schools. Now he can mention that his name is attached to a study published by Nature. \"\"I lucked out, I guess,\"\" Zucker said. Contact Richard Halstead via e-mail at rhalstead@marinij.com ' \n",

The groundbreaking technique utilises materials that soak up hydrogen like a sponge, and then encapsulates them in tiny plastic beads so small they behave like a liquid. The process, based on a new way of producing nano-fibres from hydrides, is being developed by Cella Energy, a spin-off from Britain's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The technique allows hydrogen to be released at a much faster rate and at lower temperatures than before, researchers said. \"\"What we've been doing is taking these materials and encasing them in plastic and making them into a very fine powder and that improves their properties,\"\" Cella Energy Chief Scientific Officer Stephen Bennington said. \"\"It also means you can pump it like a fluid and it's safe. It is not gong to easily burst into flames,\"\" he said. Hydrogen produces only water when it is burned and is considered an ideal solution to cutting carbon emissions from petrol or diesel vehicles, which are estimated to cause 25 per cent of all carbon release. But until now, attempts to store hydrogen have not been consumer-friendly so this has not been a viable option. Cella Energy Ltd say their technology would allow people to use the carbon-free fuel with their existing car after a few modifications. \"\"You would pump it into your petrol tank of your car - that would go off, be heated, drive the hydrogen off, which would go and run your vehicle and then the waste little beads that we have created you store in the car. And when you go and refuel your car you have two nozzles. One which puts in the new beads and one which takes out the old beads which goes off to be recycled and the hydrogen added to it again,\"\" Bennington said. The development has been to turn hydrides into fibres or beads, 30 times smaller than a human hair, through a process of electro-spinning. This produces a white tissue-like material that can be controlled to capture and release hydrogen. The encapsulation process protects the hydrides from oxygen and water, prolonging their life and making it possible to handle them safely in air and because it behaves like a liquid, current infrastructure will need minimal modification. \"\"You can use tankers to carry the material around,\"\" said Bennington. \"\"You can take it to forecourts and then you can pump it into the vehicle and give the customer the same kind of experience they have now.\"\" All part of the reason Cella Energy believe their process could herald a new era of carbon-free motoring. \"\"The experience that most people have now is using regular liquid fuels where it takes three minutes to fill your vehicle and then you can travel 300 miles,\"\" said Stephen Voller, Cella Energy's CEO. \"\"Now you can have exactly the same experience with hydrogen but you can't have that experience with an electric car.\"\" The company said hydrogen could be an economically viable alternative to fossil fuels if the gas is produced with renewable energy sources like wind or solar. It has three times more energy than petrol per unit of weight and could power cars, planes and other vehicles that currently use hydrocarbons. It said it is also attracting interest from large established companies in the energy and transportation sectors. ' \n",

Except his slicing liner kicked up chalk for the Texas Rangers. Like so many times while winning their first American League championship a year ago, the Rangers pulled off an exhilarating comeback. \"\"There isn't anything changed with those guys,\"\" manager Ron Washington said after a 9-5 win Friday over the Boston Red Sox in the season opener. Pinch-hitter Murphy's tiebreaking, two-run double off hard-throwing Daniel Bard was part of a four-run outburst in the eighth for Texas, which before the game raised the AL championship flag. \"\"My body language brought it back in. I was praying the ball would hit the chalk, and it did,\"\" Washington said. \"\"When it hit the chalk, I lost it.\"\" Rangers newcomers Mike Napoli and Yorvit Torrealba ran home to break a 5-all tie. Murphy scored on a double by Elvis Andrus before another double by AL MVP Josh Hamilton. Napoli, Ian Kinsler and Nelson Cruz all homered for the Rangers, whose opener came exactly five months after a Game 5 loss to San Francisco at home ended its first World Series. The reloaded Red Sox, who added All-Stars Adrian Gonzalez and Carl Crawford after missing the playoffs last season, blew leads of 2-0 and 4-2. \"\"Every loss is frustrating. We've got 161 to go,\"\" Kevin Youkilis said. \"\"We know we're better than we played today. There's going to be a lot of games like that this year, but hopefully not too many in a row.\"\" Murphy pinch-hit for No. 9 batter Julio Borbon, the center fielder whose two-base error on the first play of the game led to the Red Sox scoring a pair of unearned runs. Borbon remained a starter even after five errors in 21 spring training games, a move that allows the Rangers to play Hamilton in left but relegates Murphy to the bench. \"\"I do it for my teammates. I love my teammates,\"\" said Murphy, who started 105 games last season. \"\"Would I like to be included more? Yes. But if I continue to hit, I don't think I should have a problem.\"\" Bard said he made the exact pitch he wanted to Murphy. \"\"Sinker down and away. It was on the knees, outer black,\"\" Bard said. \"\"He just barely got the bat to it. Three inches to the left and that's a foul ball, and we're having a different conversation.\"\" Darren Oliver, the third Texas reliever, got the victory even after allowing a homer to David Ortiz in the top of the eighth that tied it at 5.

On Friday, he couldn't find the proper spin on his breaking balls or enough zip on his heaters. It added up to a terrible 2011 debut for the Colorado Rockies ace who started out 15-1 last season. Jimenez looked like he was throwing batting practice Friday, laboring through six innings, allowing six runs — five earned — on seven hits and a wild pitch in a 7-6, 11-inning loss to Arizona at Coors Field. He was long gone by the time Matt Lindstrom's wild pitch with one out in the top of the 11th inning allowed Gerardo Parra to score from third base with the go-ahead run. All but one of the hits he allowed went for extra bases, including home runs by Justin Upton and Miguel Montero. Knowing he lacked his usual breaking stuff, he stuck with fastballs, but his heaters were topping out at 93 mph instead of the usual 99-100. \"\"If I have the speed that I normally do, it's not easy to hit it even if they know that I'm going to be throwing fastball every time,\"\" Jimenez said. \"\"But I didn't have the movement, I didn't have the speed.\"\" After averaging 8.7 strikeouts per nine innings last year, Colorado's ace whiffed just one batter. His unusual futility finally caught up to him in the fifth, when Upton's three-run homer put Arizona ahead 4-3. \"\"It wasn't as electric,\"\" Upton said of Jimenez's repertoire. \"\"I don't know exactly what he was throwing but it wasn't jumping like it usually does.\"\" Jimenez said he couldn't locate his curveball in the bullpen warming up and had to stick with fastballs. \"\"That's the only thing I had,\"\" he said. And without the usual oomph, he didn't even have that. In the sixth, Montero collected his fifth career hit — and third career homer — off Jimenez, sending a 2-1 pitch into the bullpen in right-center to give the Diamondbacks a 6-3 cushion. \"\"It's kind of weird. To be honest, I don't think he was throwing that hard,\"\" Montero said. \"\"Today he didn't have the greatest stuff, he wasn't throwing near as hard as (normal) and we were able to take advantage.\"\" Jimenez, last year's NL All-Star Game starter, walked away with a 7.50 ERA. Jimenez felt worst, however, about walking pitcher Ian Kennedy in the fifth before allowing a single to Willie Bloomquist, who started at shortstop with Stephen Drew held out of the lineup as he recovers from a strained abdominal muscle. One out later, Upton's three-run shot put Arizona ahead. \"\"That's what hurt me the most,\"\" Jimenez said. \"\"You never want to be walking the pitcher. Every time that happens, it's going to get in your head and always there's a problem that's going to come after that.\"\" The last time Jimenez struck out just one batter was on May 21, 2008, against San Francisco, when he tossed seven innings in a no-decision. Jimenez said he felt fine physically and wasn't worried that this bad outing was more than a one-time deal, and his teammates brushed off their ace's unusually poor performance. \"\"He can be nervous, too. He's allowed that,\"\" Todd Helton said. \"\"His stuff looked good. I think we're all right.\"\" NOTE: Colorado RHP Aaron Cook (broken finger) made 50 throws at 100 feet Friday as he embarked on his comeback that is expected to last for weeks. ' \n",

(AP) — Kila Ka'aihue hit Michael Kohn's second pitch of the ninth inning for a game-ending home run, lifting the Kansas City Royals to a 2-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night. Kohn (0-1) relieved Jordan Walden to start the ninth and was ahead 0-1 in the count when Ka'aihue, who had struck out twice, slammed the ball 393 feet over the fence in right. Joakim Soria (1-0) pitched the ninth for Kansas City. The Royals tied it 1-all in the fourth on an infield out by Jeff Francoeur after Billy Butler singled and moved up on a hit and a wild pitch. Howie Kendrick gave the Angels a 1-0 lead on the eighth pitch that starter Jeff Francis threw as a Royal, swatting the full-count delivery over the fence in center for a 418-foot home run. But that was all the Angels would get off Francis, a 30-year-old who is still trying to make a full comeback from left shoulder surgery that sidelined him the entire 2009 season and part of 2010. The Angels had at least one base runner in five of the next six innings but could not break through against the 6-foot-5 left-hander, stranding runners in scoring position in the second, third and fifth. Starters Dan Haren of the Angels and Francis both went seven impressive innings, allowing only one run and six hits. Haren, going for his fourth win in his last five starts in Kansas City, hurt himself with a wild pitch that helped the Royals score their lone run off him. He had six strikeouts and no walks. Francis, who signed as a free agent from Colorado, gave up five hits and one run, walking one and striking out four. Vernon Wells made a great catch to stop the Royals from taking the lead in the sixth. Alex Gordon doubled leading off, went to third on Butler's groundball and was there with two outs when Francoeur hit a line drive into deep left. Wells went back and made a leaping catch almost at the wall. The Royals also stranded a runner at third in the third, fifth and eighth. Mike Aviles tripled with two outs in the third but Haren struck out Melky Cabrera. In the fifth, Brayan Pena doubled leading off and was at third when Aviles popped up and Cabrera flied out. Aviles walked leading off the eighth against reliever Walden and went to third with two outs when he stole second and kept going on catcher Jeff Mathis' throwing error. But Walden struck out Butler. NOTES: Angels are opening season at Kansas City for the first time. ... According to Angels' research, Mathis was only third man in major league history to hit an opening day home run on his birthday. ... With a payroll of $36,126,000 and an opening day average age of 27.21, Royals are youngest and poorest team in the majors. ' \n",

Google said two of the companies named were its units, and a third was a separate firm that works closely with Google. But Google denied the tax violations alleged in the Chinese-language Economic Daily. \"\"We believe we are, and always have been, in full compliance with Chinese tax law,\"\" Google said in a statement. Even if the report is unfounded or embellished, it could bring fresh headaches in China for Google, which has gone through difficult times there since early last year when it clashed with the government over internet censorship and hacking attacks. China generates a small percentage of Google's revenues, but is the world's largest internet market with more than 450 million users. The country's search market, dominated by homegrown Baidu Inc, was worth 11bn yuan (£1.05bn) in 2010 and is likely to grow by about 50% each year for the next four years, according to iResearch. The Economic Daily said that the three companies investigated and punished were \"\"Google enterprises in China\"\". \"\"The taxation authorities have already investigated and punished the three companies according to the law,\"\" said the report on its front page. The companies were accused of presenting false and unjustified claims to the total value of 40m yuan, said the report. It did not say when the claimed violations are alleged to have happened. \"\"It is understood by this reporter that the taxation authorities are further investigating Google businesses in China on suspicion of tax avoidance,\"\" said the brief story, which was also later reported by China's official Xinhua news agency. A Google spokesperson said the two of the accused companies - Google Information Technology (China) Co Ltd and and Google Information Technology (Shanghai) Co Ltd - were its sub-units. It said the third company named, Google Advertising (Shanghai) Co Ltd, was a separate firm which works \"\"closely with Google as Google's sole first-tier reseller in China\"\" of advertising on the search engine's web pages. \"\"Most foreign companies in China, especially high-profile companies with a global reputation at stake, are pretty careful to make sure they are in full compliance with the relevant tax laws,\"\" said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting, a Beijing-based company that advises investors about China's Internet and telecommunications sectors. China's foreign ministry would not comment directly about the report. \"\"Generally speaking, any companies operating abroad should obey the laws and regulations of the host country,\"\" said the ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu. The report appeared after Google again clashed with the Chinese government over internet censorship. Earlier this month, Google said any difficulty that users in China may have faced opening its email service were likely the result of government blocks. China's ruling Communist party has intensified censorship in recent months, fearing that calls for protests inspired by anti-authoritarian uprisings across the Middle East and north Africa could gather momentum. Google's serious run-ins with the Chinese government began in January 2010, when the company said it was no longer willing to censor search results in the country. Previously, the company included a disclaimer on its China service that searches may not be complete because of local laws. ' \n",

The Wall Street Journal’s homepage rendered in Comic Sans using the Google Chrome tool. Eek. The search giant Friday morning launched an all-out campaign to promote the font Comic Sans on the Web. For those who don't know, Comic Sans is the typeface that looks kind of like neat printed handwriting — and it's widely ridiculed by graphic designers and Internet denizens. It was the subject of a Wall Street Journal article in 2009 (Headline: A Font of Ill Will), and it makes Web pages basically unreadable. But the Google webmaster team said Friday that it would be rolling out Comic Sans as the default Google font across all Google products on April 4. They said experiments had shown that users \"\"thoroughly read every piece of content displayed in Comic Sans\"\" and that it is \"\"the most effective way to achieve user happiness.\"\" They also introduced an extension for the Chrome Web browser that turns all text on all Web pages into Comic Sans. (Try it. It's horrifying.) And they provided a special little treat for those of us who search for \"\"Helvetica\"\" (another font) on Google. Not to be outdone, the Gmail team said it was introducing something called Gmail Motion — gesture commands for email users. They even produced a snappy video and a printable guide to sample gestures.

In a chest-beating blog post, Microsoft revealed that WinPho7\"\"s app count stands at 11,500, and that's without wallpapers or duplicate apps in different languages. The ecosystem has 36,000 developers, 60 percent of which haven't even published anything yet, so the potential for growth is huge. Still, some tech pundits, such as Robert Scoble, insist that a lack of apps is the only reason Windows Phone 7 hasn't been a rousing success. How can this be true if the Windows Phone Marketplace is hopping with activity? First, a bit of qualification: We don't know with absolute certainty that Windows Phones aren't selling. Microsoft has only said how many phones it's sold to retailers (1.5 million as of late December), not the number of people who've actually bought one. But LG has expressed disappointment with sales, and one U.K. retailer claimed that Android phones outsell Windows Phones by a 15 to 1 ratio. It's safe to say that Windows Phone 7 hasn't been a rousing success. Windows Phone 7\"\"s Real Challenges But is a lack of apps to blame? I doubt it. When I consider which phone to buy or recommend to friends, I'm quick to rule out Windows Phone 7, but not because of apps. The platform's lack of multitasking and HTML5 support are much bigger drawbacks. Same with copy and paste, at least until Microsoft finishes rolling out the \"\"NoDo\"\" software update. And until Windows Phones come to Verizon Wireless, the number of people who can even consider the platform is limited. Windows Phone 7 hardware has also been unimpressive so far. Most handsets don't have front-facing cameras. None have dual-core processors. Most lack expandable storage, which wouldn't be an issue if they included more than 8 GB or 16 GB of on-board storage. Every time an Android phone pushes the hardware envelope, Windows Phone 7 falls further behind. If none of those issues existed, apps might linger in the back of my mind, but I doubt it. After all, Windows Phone 7 has a great gaming platform in Xbox Live. It has apps for Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, Shazam, IMDB and even Netflix, which Android still lacks. With Microsoft's new stats in mind, I simply don't buy the argument that apps are holding the platform back. If anything, they're the biggest bright spot for Windows Phone 7 so far. ' \n",

Measure It With Google&#8217;s Page Speed Online Editors note: The following guest post is written by Josh Fraser. Josh is the co-founder of a new startup called Torbit which automatically optimizes websites for speed. Yesterday Google announced Page Speed Online, which provides a quick and easy way to accurately measure the speed of your website directly from the web. Previously available only as a browser add-on, Google Labs launch allows you to analyze your site from anywhere and receive instant feedback on making it faster. Chances are, your website could perform better - all of ours could. There are a lot of tools online that only measure server response time, giving an inaccurate picture of your site's speed. For example, blazing fast servers might return your HTML in a fraction of a second, but visitors to your site will still be waiting for images to download or javascript to be executed. In contrast, Page Speed Online uses a webkit-based renderer to time all components of your site for a more complete picture of its performance. Page Speed Online is simple to use. Just enter a URL and get instant suggestions for performance improvements on your site. Page Speed Online gives you a score out of 100 and breaks down suggestions by their priority. Google caches the results, making it faster to use than comparative tools like WebPageTest which offers more features. With Page Speed Online you can also get mobile-specific recommendations. For instance, since mobile device CPUs are less powerful than desktop CPUs, suggestions that reduce CPU consumption will be featured more prominently. Performance matters. We all know that. Everyone can relate to the frustration of waiting on a site that takes forever to load. Website owners in particular should care about performance. The correlation between the speed of your website and revenue has been shown over and over again. Improving your site's performance is the easiest way to increase pageviews, conversions and sales. For example, Yahoo found that a 400ms improvement to the speed of their site increased their pageviews by 9%. Firefox shaved 2.2 seconds off their average page load time and increased download conversions by 15.4%. Shopzilla reduced their loading time from 7 seconds to 2 and increased their pageviews by 25% and revenue by 7-12%. Google has been a long-time champion of making the internet faster. Not only did it rise to prominence by being the fastest search engine, but it also encourages other sites to be fast by using site speed in its web search ranking. Google has also released a slew of tools to help website owners measure and improve the performance of their sites. Google released Page Speed plugins for Firefox and Chrome and include performance data in its webmaster tools. Just yesterday, Steve Souders announced HTTPArchive which keeps an archive of how top websites are built and tracks their performance ranking over time. The data is being recorded using real browsers so the archive is an accurate representation of the experience of actual visitors. Performance is obviously a priority for Google and it's something we all value. Venture capitalist Fred Wilson even calls speed \"\"the #1 feature for startups\"\". Page Speed Online is an important step for the web because it's lowering the bar for people who want to do performance analysis on their sites. You no longer have to download desktop software, install a plugin or even have a copy of the browser that you're testing – all you need is any browser. Google employee and performance guru, Steve Souders told me a story from a party he attended where a startup CTO was asking him for site improvement suggestions: I didn’t have my laptop handy and was about to give up, but then I remembered Page Speed Online. From my mobile phone I was able to run his site through Page Speed Online and give him specific performance fixes. On top of that were the suggestions for mobile. Page Speed Online provides performance analysis for any website for desktop and mobile from any web client. I also talked with the tech lead for Page Speed Online, Bryan McQuade and asked him what was next for the service. He says: Going forward we’re planning to add even more mobile-targeted analysis to the open-source Page Speed SDK, which powers Page Speed Online, our Page Speed browser extensions, and is used by WebPagetest and other sites. Of course, Page Speed Online will only tell you that your site is slow; it won't fix it for you (although there is an Apache module that helps). Our company, Torbit, and others such as Disrupt runner-up CloudFlare and Blaze.io, are working to automate all these best-practises to make websites fast. Torbit is still in private BETA, but you can sign up now to get in before our public launch. ' \n",

Will Kutcher and Bieber make as woeful a double act as Robert Carlyle and Samuel L Jackson, or Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy? The script for What Would Kenny Do? has had a terrific birth. A buddy comedy about a 17-year-old boy guided by a hologram of himself as an adult, it made the prestigious Black List of unproduced screenplays three years ago, before being touched up by (500) Days of Summer's Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber. Now Will Smith's production company is interested in finally taking it to the screen. But don't get too excited. It's been reported that the two stars of What Would Kenny Do? look set to be Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber. Again, that's Ashton Kutcher - last seen playing Ashton Kutcher in a film about Ashton Kutcher being Ashton Kutcher. And Justin Bieber - last seen being shot to death on an episode of CSI. Together. On screen. At the same time. Together. Worse still, depending on your point of view, Ashton Kutcher will be playing a version of Justin Bieber or Justin Bieber will be playing a version of Ashton Kutcher. Either way, you should probably brace yourself for something genuinely nightmarish. But if Kutcher and Bieber think that they can just swan in and become the most offensively terrible double act of all time, they've got another thing coming. Movie history is littered with the corpses of hopelessly mismatched buddy films, and Kutcher and Bieber will have to go over and above the call of duty if they even want to breathe the same air as some of the worst. For example, it barely seems feasible that Kutcher and Bieber could be as spectacularly woeful as Robert Carlyle and the kilt-wearing version of Samuel L Jackson in The 51st State. Prior to that film, Carlyle was the fiery future of British acting and Jackson was the coolest man alive. Afterwards, Carlyle slunk off to America to make dodgy sci-fi TV shows and Jackson primarily became known for being the bloke out of Snakes on a Plane. And there's little chance that What Would Kenny Do? will be nearly as hopeless as 1997\"\"s Double Team, the film that consciously decided to buddy Jean-Claude Van Damme with green-haired basketball weirdo Dennis Rodman and make them battle a nonspecific international conspiracy by jumping out of an aeroplane and getting chased around by tigers. Or Burt Reynolds and nine-year-old Norman D Golden II in Cop And A Half. Or Sylvester Stallone and Estelle Getty in Stop or My Mom Will Shoot. Or Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett in Hollywood Homicide. And I'll be staggered if Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber could summon up even less chemistry than Pat Morita and Jay Leno managed in their godawful 1989 action comedy Collision Course. But perhaps we shouldn't write Kutcher and Bieber off yet. After all, as both a former and prospective host of MTV's Punk'd, they obviously have an affinity with abject dreadfulness. And if there are any two people on Earth capable of being as stingingly unwatchable as Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy were in 2002\"\"s Showtime, it's them. I'm sure they won't let me down. ' \n",

It’s a very British coup — legendary US director Terrence Malick’s long-awaited new film The Tree of Life, starring Brad Pitt and Sean Penn, is to receive its world premiere not in Cannes next month, but a week earlier in the UK. Its distribution company, Icon, has confirmed its May 4 British release date to me. Speculation about the film has been swirling for more than a year; at one point, it was expected to be screened in Cannes last year. This all adds to the mystique that surrounds the elusive Malick. The film’s American distributor, Fox Searchlight, was clearly taken by surprise by news of the UK opening, describing it as “not true” to a Hollywood website. My guess is that the film will still be shown in Cannes, though not in competition for the Palme d’Or. What do you get when you combine the talents of Johnny Depp, gonzo author-journalist Hunter S Thompson and Bruce Robinson, wayward writer‑director of Withnail and I? A combustible mix, certainly. Or maybe three good reasons to look forward to the autumn release of Rum Diary, a film based on Thompson’s semi-autobiographical novel, starring Depp and scripted by Robinson, who has also directed; it’s his first film in nearly 20 years. Thompson (who died in 2005) showed Depp the draft of his Rum Diary novel 15 years back, while Depp was shooting another of his works, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and urged him to star in it. I gather Rum Diary, in which Depp plays a thinly disguised journalist, down on his luck in Puerto Rico, was completed two years ago. It certainly won’t be boring. ' \n",

Car manufacturers, the auto shows in Detroit. When Hollywood wants to tout its upcoming wares, it heads to Las Vegas. CinemaCon, as the just-concluded annual Nevada gathering of movie theater owners now calls itself, is part beauty pageant — a smattering of stars fly in to promote their films to the thousands of exhibitors on hand — and part trade show, with vendors such as American Licorice showing off their yummy new Natural Vines (in both red and black licorice) and Icee unveiling its not-too-sweet strawberry lemonade flavor. It's altogether fitting that most of the convention's film presentations have been held just a few yards from the sports book at Caesars Palace, where bettors lay wagers on who will win far-off events such as the World Series, the Stanley Cup Finals and the NBA championship. Even though many of the movies being hawked at CinemaCon don't open for months, exhibitors already are making bets on which movies they think will (and will not) be winners at the box office. In years past, almost all of the major studios staged elaborate luncheons and dinners to plug their slates. This year, Disney, Warner Bros., DreamWorks Animation, Paramount, Marvel Studios, Lionsgate and DreamWorks Studios presented an array of trailers, clips and even several films in full, with Sony showing the Kevin James romantic comedy \"\"Zookeeper\"\" and Lionsgate screening its mixed martial arts movie \"\"Warrior.\"\" Much of the selling was aimed at summer bookings. From May through September, the major studios and big independents will introduce some three dozen movies in wide release, many of which open on the same weekends. Exhibitors seemed to think there were three movies that will clearly dominate the schools-out season: Warner Bros.\"\" \"\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 2,\"\" Paramount and Hasbro's \"\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\"\" and Disney's \"\"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.\"\" The real CinemaCon test was in making the second tier of movies stand out from their brethren. In many ways, the film clips were designed to draw distinctions — you may think our movie is this, but it's really this. Pixar and Disney's \"\"Cars 2\"\" isn't an animated movie but a spy thriller. Paramount and Marvel Studios\"\" \"\"Thor\"\" may be about a Norse god comic-book figure, yet it's actually funny. DreamWorks Animation's \"\"Puss in Boots\"\" is more than a \"\"Shrek\"\" spin-off: It's a Sergio Leone western that happens to star a talking cat. And DreamWorks Studio's \"\"Real Steel\"\" might look like a movie about fighting robots, but don't underestimate the father-son love story. Who succeeded the best? J.J. Abrams showed about 20 minutes of \"\"Super 8,\"\" a period drama about young kids who stumble into an alien invasion (picture \"\"Stand By Me\"\" crossed with \"\"Cloverfield\"\"), that sparked a lot of exhibitor interest. DreamWorks Studios screened footage from \"\"The Help\"\" that it is confident will expand the film's audience far beyond the millions of readers of the bestselling novel. And even National Geographic Films got into the act, bringing its inspirational drama \"\"The First Grader\"\" to Las Vegas to show theater owners that the film is not just a festival favorite but a crowd-pleaser as well. But the best judge of what the movie business is excited about comes from the 6,000 convention guests themselves. The people on the Las Vegas ground this week — theater owners, distributors, filmmakers, studio executives and representatives from affiliated industries — are paid to know what audiences want. We asked a variety of CinemaCon guests to pick the summer's top-grossing film, its biggest bust and most popular sleeper.

The convention, previously known as ShoWest is \"\"the largest cinema trade show in the world\"\" (www.cinemacon.com) It was at this convention that filmmaker James Cameron (Titanic, Avatar) delivered a presentation entitled \"\"A Demonstration and Exclusive Look at the Future of Cinema.\"\" The last time Cameron spoke at ShoWest, he and George Lucas had presented a plea to the movie industry to begin its huge investment in digital filmmaking technology in preparation of the 3D revolution that was bound to take over cinema. One year removed from the release of Cameron's technologically groundbreaking and box office titan Avatar , the film industry seems to have done exactly what Cameron and Lucas predicted. With the addition of digital projection systems to nearly every major cineplex or theater around the nation and of course the overwhelming use of 3D, one cannot help but trust that Cameron knows what he is talking about.When he spoke this year at Cinemacon, he, once again, spoke of a revolution. Instead of promoting 3D cinema, this time around Cameron talked framerates. Framerates, for those not fluent in film jargon, is the term used to describe the speed at which a camera shoots and subsequently plays back individual frames on a film strip. The industry standard has been 24 frames per second (fps) since around the mid-20\"\"s, as it is believed to be the closest to mimicking reality. However, filmmakers have always experimented with framerates whether it be shooting at slower frame rates to produce a sensation of fast motion (think: the this scene in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange) or shooting at faster framerates like 48 fps to produce what is known as slow motion (think: sports instant replays, or this funny video.\"\" Advertisement Cameron wants the industry standard to change. He believes that by making the industry standard something like 48 fps, not only does the clarity of the image go from \"\"Good\"\" to \"\"Holy S%@#!,\"\" he believes it will improve and smooth out any movement that the camera utilizes. With handheld footage practically being an independent film standard, it will help translate to a smoother, more pleasurable film experience. His argument is an interesting one and one that is technically relevant and affordable for all kinds of filmmakers. With the almost overwhelming transition from film to digital, the cost of shooting at higher framerates is almost null and void. Most of the newest digital video cameras like Canon's 5D and 7D already shoot at a standard close to 30 fps. So, shooting digitally, one doesn't have to empty their wallet too much to afford to shoot at higher framerates. That being said, Cameron's proposal presents an interesting direction for the future of cinema. Many filmmakers like Peter Jackson and of course James Cameron have already experimented with increased framerates, and their arument is surely a compelling one, one the industry will have to keep an eye on.

Ever since The Clone Wars series began 2 1/2 years ago, speculation has run rampant that at some point we'd see wookiees, and specifically the beloved Chewbacca, before they're ensnared by the Empire post Revenge of the Sith. \"\"Good relation with the Wookies, I have\"\", Yoda mentions to his fellow Jedi Council members in the aforementioned film, leading us to speculate where this connection hails from. After seeing The Clone Wars' latest and last episode of Season Three, \"\"Wookiee Hunt\"\", premiering tonight, it's safe to say we don't get to see this direct connection explored at this time, but the ending definitely sets up for that relationship down the line. Supervising Director Dave Filoni, and Director of this two-episode story arc, has said that new character models created for use in the show are never prepared for one-time use, due to the time and resources they require. This recent interview quip hints at future episodes involving the \"\"big walking carpet\"\", which may indeed go into that relationship, whose beginnings may've been broached here at the end of \"\"Wookiee Hunt\"\"; it's in the final scene that we see Chewbacca standing on a landing pad with our contingent of heroes, including wise Council Master Yoda. Though there's no dialogue between them, yet there's a pervasive sense that a new alliance has just been forged with the Wookiees, who've protected and saved the Jedi Padawans; surely this act will not be forgotten, and may be the inroads to a special working interaction in Season 4 and beyond. In my review of \"\"Padawan Lost\"\" I said much about the incredible environments of Felucia and Wasskah, the lighting and animation implemented to bring its breathtaking beauty to life, and the sheer terror the Trandoshan hunters instill as they carry out their cinematic homage to The Most Dangerous Game (1932), which I'm happy to report carries on for this installment as well. I also went into the great characterization of one of the Padawans, Kalifa, and noted how I was looking forward to also being able to become better-acquainted with the two others, O-Mer and Jinx. We do indeed get a good deal of characterization concerning them both, but the real standout, as it should be, is in the animation quality and verisimilitude exhibited by Peter Mayhew's Chewbacca. It just goes to show the lengths that Filoni and crew are willing to go to in translating the zeal and energy from the live-action films into a medium that will better connect the two trilogies into the cohesive 13 hr. epic we know so well. Most would never even question that an actor in a big furry suit has a particular grace and style that's inconic and instantly-recognizable, yet you know it when you see it. The fact that The Clone Wars team brought Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew into the studio for reference works so well, you'll be gasping at the sight of him in action, and instantly recognize that he truly is the one and only actor for the role. From his expressive eyes, to his real-life 7 ft. 3 in. lumbering stride, to the casual way he leans back into a relaxed pose, it's all Chewie. And with Mayhew's practiced Wookiee growl through the years at conventions, for the first time it's his voice helping to bring the zoo animal-sound mixture into the familiar and resonate growl we all know and love. Advertisement The action in this episode is indeed intense and engaging, and visually-pays off what fans have long heard of, yet never yet seen: Wookiees engaging in battle against the slithery Trandoshan slavers that would ensnare them. Having Ahsoka and the two remaining Padawans in the mix of the battle makes it that much more thrilling, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention the superb blending of iconic John Williams' Star Wars musical themes in all the right places; never overused, it is implemented by series' musical composer Kevin Kiner in just the right dosage to really get the gooseflesh standing up in all the right moments. In other words, Chewie's big return is all it's been hyped up to be, and if it's not already more than enough that we'll be seeing the survivor Darth Maul back in action down the road, one can now begin dreaming that a future Chewie appearance will be graced by his rescuer, a brash young Corellian pirate who turned mainstream audiences onto the sci-fantasy epic in the first place, with his cynical everyman point-of-entry into that world as Han Solo. As always, there are never any guarantees of that, but just my own speculation; but however George Lucas, Filoni, and crew forge ahead with Season 4, we can rest assured it's only going to be nothing short of continuing to be mind-blowing.

So how are three of the drama's main stars spending their hiatus? Jon Hamm can be seen in the L.A. Theater Works production of Chekhov's \"\"Three Sisters\"\" from April 13-17. In addition to having a cameo in Kristen Wiig's Universal Pictures comedy \"\"Bridesmaids\"\" (out May 13), he also just wrapped the comedy \"\"Friends with Kids,\"\" directed by his girlfriend Jennifer Westfeldt and co-starring Megan Fox. Elisabeth Moss now appears in the West End production of \"\"The Children's Hour\"\" with Keira Knightley. It has extended its run through May 7. She also has wrapped up three projects: The comedy, \"\"A Buddy Story;\"\" \"\"On the Road\"\" about beat poet Jack Kerouac; and \"\"Darling Companion,\"\" starring Diane Keaton, about a woman who loves her dog more than her husband. Christina Hendricks recently joined the cast of \"\"Company\"\" at the New York Philharmonic, which plays Apr. 7-9. Filming is currently underway on her comedy \"\"I Don't Know How She Does It,\"\" in which she co-stars with Sarah Jessica Parker. She also has signed on for \"\"Seconds of Pleasure,\"\" a series of vignettes connecting the lives of people traveling on the same airplane, with Matt Dillon and Kristin Scott Thomas.

Director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell, who gave us the original \"\"Saw\"\" (which is better than you remember), reteam for this update on the classic haunted-house thriller - which uses its creaking noises and fast shocks to good effect. Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) move into a new house with their three kids. But domestic bliss is shortlived, when oldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) falls into a coma, which has no medical explanation. Renai comes to believe that what's happening is supernatural - and even convinces Josh to move the family to a new house. Moving doesn't help, as the dark forces follow the family. \"\"It's not the house that's haunted - it's your son,\"\" gravely explains Elise, a no-nonsense psychic played by screen veteran Lin Shaye, who steals the movie. Wan ratchets up the old-school shocks, starting with the occasional door slam and building to a chaotic finale that bridges the real world and a deathly realm cryptically called \"\"The Further.\"\" Whannell's script is leavened by the comic relief of two nerdy paranormal investigators, played by Whannell and Angus Sampson. \"\"Insidious\"\" is the rare example of a PG-13 movie that delivers genuine chills, without excessive blood and gore.

Instead it's in south Devon, where its white yachts, paved coastal esplanades and streets lined with palm trees give off an LA glamour, undermined only by the need for layers. Joe Mount, the man behind Metronomy and the Guardian's escort around this seaside town, grew up in Torbay and nearby Totnes, \"\"making my own fun\"\" going to beach parties while driving round the bay blasting Ace Of Base. In the winter, while the bay hibernated, he'd fiddle with electronic sounds on his home computer. By the time Joe was 18, Metronomy was fully formed in his mind. Almost immediately, he moved away. As a student in Brighton he put together a band to play his songs, enlisting his cousin Oscar Cash and Gabriel Stebbing to play keyboards and bass. Mount then moved to London where he made up for a youth without a scene. \"\"I became so absorbed in London,\"\" he says. \"\"I was caring about what NME said, who the new bands were, getting jealous when others were doing better than us. I was going out every night, just because I could.\"\" Metronomy's second album, Nights Out, offered despondent reportage from that metropolitan underworld. Or, as Mount puts it now: \"\"Eugh, parties.\"\" Nights Out was successful enough for Mount to spend the next year attending parties, in places which had pop music in their bones: \"\"Where I'm from, if you're into music you really struggle. There are no venues, no bands, no scene. I wanted to make music like that for the people I grew up with.\"\" So where there wasn't a scene, Joe started to imagine one. He summoned up images of American west coast cool. He loved the thought of workshy stoner bands, sleeping in until 12, hitting the beach and stumbling across songbook classics like shells in the sand. \"\"This area is very laid-back, there are kids who've got so much time they can spend hours in a recording studio and make this sun-kissed, seaside music.\"\" he says. \"\"I was trying to imagine what that would sound like. That's why the new album shares its name with the English Riviera.\"\" \"\"This area is very laid-back ... the kids can spend hours in a studio and make this sun-kissed, seaside music I was trying to imagine what that would sound like\"\" Joe Mount of Metronomy dresses for a day on the English Riviera. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian For Metronomy's regeneration into a laid-back coastal band to be complete, Joe had to take himself aside for a chat. While he had been in the grip of his musical fantasies, bandmate Gabriel left the band to concentrate on being frontman of Your Twenties. It forced Joe to reconsider the concept of Metronomy as \"\"a spiky synth, wonk-pop party band\"\" and retool it as a four-piece. Squeaking doors and 99p toy synthesizers, staples of Metronomy's sound until now, were replaced by more delicate percussion and warm lounge keyboards: \"\"Although the album is self-produced, I imagined what a producer would say to me. The first thing he'd say would be, \"\"Stop cluttering up your songs with weird little noises.\"\"\"\" So that was that: Metronomy transformed themselves from a new-rave London three-piece to the Fleetwood Mac of the West Country. Welcome to The English Riviera: please drift slowly. Wind in our hair and sun on our skin, it's easy to buy in to Joe's American dream in the golden-brown resort that English pessimism forgot. Torbay, however, is still Torbay. We walk down the wide coastal road, lined by what looks like a Jersey Shore theme parkwith lurid arcades called Stardust, Regency Palace and Leisure 2000. The bar we go into might serve mojitos on tap, but the sex-toy vending machine in the toilet proffers inflatable sheep. Mount finds a flyer boasting \"\"LADY GAGA IS IN TOTNES TONIGHT\"\" with a picture of a girl in a blonde wig and papier-mache dress. A quick Google search reveals she does Christina and Britney tributes, too. As for Mount himself, he wouldn't know how to deploy the bombast that comes naturally to Californians. His face spattered with brown freckles, his manner is polite, considered and encumbered by a modest Englishness. His answers are always suffixed with an awkward \"\"... but I don't know\"\", and he describes the popularity of the XX and James Blake as the rise of \"\"groovy music\"\" . It's this clash of Super-8 US fantasy with stark English reality that makes The English Riviera a triumph. Its sparse arrangements, commanding first-person narrative and off-kilter rhythms will lead to comparisons with LCD Soundsystem. But while James Murphy's barbed nihilism is a deadpan dissection of New York living, Mount's rose-tinted love letter to Torbay paints a picture of a home to which he'd like to return. \"\"I know, it's not very cool to be from the south, is it?\"\" he says. \"\"But it would be so disrespectful to people who grew up in worse places to just moan about where you came from.\"\" \"\"Nights Out was a bit cynical,\"\" adds Oscar. \"\"This one's supposed to be affectionate. It's offering a sound to bands: here's an idea, you could try this.\"\" \"\"It's not very cool to be from the south, is it? But it's so disrespectful to people who grew up in worse places to just moan about where you come from\"\" Metronomy keyboards and sax man Oscar Cash. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian The record has none of the brashness of US yacht rock. Even its most brazen moment, The Bay, a paean to Torbay's sexy charm, isn't a boast as much as a spurt of giddy excitement. Its charisma lies in the bits of Americana it gets wrong. It's groovy music. After a few jugs of - go on then - the on-tap mojitos, the idea of Masqueradey Gaga is starting to appeal. A taxi ride later, we're in a drab hotel conference room where a woman dressed in a leotard and wrapped in party lights is bent over a Roland keyboard and warbling something that sounds a bit like Poker Face. Behind her, two very enthusiastic male dancers do their best to make the whole thing look less like The Mighty Boosh. After the third airing of Bad Romance, we give up and head to the kebab shop to talk about our favourite Magic FM bands over a polystyrene box full of sweating lettuce. \"\"These LA bands like the Beach Boys and the Eagles: they had so much time,\"\" says Mount, doner meat dangling from his lip. \"\"It was just, \"\"Let's go chill out. Smoke a doob. Spend three months in the studio. Smoke a doob.\"\"\"\" Does he think it's the same here? \"\"I think it could be. But all it ends up creating is drum'n'bass DJs, tribute acts and singer-songwriter shit. There's another guy from round here who got a record deal recently who does that James Morrison style-thing. That's what it creates: a kind of douchebaggery.\"\" The next day Joe flies off to Paris to play a DJ set at 4am. Once he'd been blinded by stage lights, the charms of a Torbay sunset were never going to be enough. But he no longer fears the ennui that follows a small-town upbringing, nor that of middling indie fame. He may not be the coolest man in London, but Joe smiles the smile of a man who know he's already lodged himself into local history. \"\"I've already been getting emails from the English Riviera tourist board,\"\" he grins. \"\"Their Google alerts must be going crazy.\"\" ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'The rise of the Twitter tribes Lady Gaga's rounding up the Monsters, and Rihanna got her fans joining the Navy. Meanwhile, Pixie Lott is all about the Crazycats Following pop stars on Twitter is clearly a brilliant way to pass the time. How else are we supposed to know that Craig David is off to the gym to \"\"fine tune the physique ... lol\"\" or that Taio Cruz has \"\"had a couple weeks of no shades wearing\"\"? It collapses the barrier between pop star and pop fan, encouraging dialogue (mainly things like, \"\"@onedirection OMG Harry if you don't follow me back I'll cry 4ever, plz RT\"\") and gives the pop star (or his/her record label) access to millions of fans that can be crowd-sourced in no more than 140 characters. Recently, that dialogue has been enhanced by the creation of so-called Twitter tribes, a way for fans to pledge allegiance to their favourite pop star and feel part of their world without having to part with a £30 annual fee for a badge and photocopied autograph. Nowadays, it's all about deciding whose side you're on, and hashtagging like your life depends on it. So the questions pop fans need to ask themselves are manifold; are you one of the #Monsters or the #Barbz? Will you be joining team #Navy? If pushed, would you say your allegiance is to the #Beasties or the #Heartbeats? Whatever you do, please say you're not a #Crazycat ... It's all nonsense of course, but interesting nonsense, not least because it reveals a lot about the person coining the phrase. For Lady Gaga, calling her fans \"\"Monsters\"\" makes sense; her image is built on subverting perceived notions of beauty, and she promotes the idea of people displaying their flaws, being who they really are. It also helps that her fans are properly fanatical, latching on to this term and proudly defining themselves as such. Likewise, Nicki Minaj's exaggerated femininity is encapsulated by \"\"Barbz\"\", a term she says refers to \"\"women and gay boys\"\". Both are ridiculous, larger-than-life pop superstars who seem to live via an alter ego. Now, this doesn't work so well with Pixie Lott. Calling your fans \"\"Crazycats\"\" brings to mind a \"\"down with the kids\"\" mum trying to ingratiate herself with her teenage daughter: \"\"You guys were up until 11.45pm last night? You crazy cats!\"\" While Gaga drip-feeds exclusive information on new artwork, single premieres and things fans genuinely want to know, Lott uses the phrase \"\"stay crazy\"\" like an excitable children's TV presenter. For Rihanna and her \"\"Navy\"\", things have moved to the next level. Not only is there a designated @rihannanavy Twitter feed (\"\"Introducing a new era of fandom\"\") but there's also a preposterous two-minute Navy recruitment video with text that reads: \"\"Her appearance infatuates us, her strength feeds us, her music created us - the Navy wants you.\"\" It's simultaneously jaw-droppingly ridiculous and amazing. Just like wearing Grolsch bottle tops on your laces seemed a little silly once Bros had split up, and walking around Tesco with one sparkly glove didn't scream \"\"zeitgeist\"\" post-1984, it's not clear how long this trend will last or how it will evolve. Fingers crossed that once people reach a certain age they'll stop wanting to be defined as a \"\"Crazycat\"\", for both the sake of their mental health and musical taste. ' \n",

So, here, when a discarded car tyre rolls to life and starts destroying objects and then creatures with its explosive mental powers, it's best to simply accept its supernatural abilities. And why not?

Mr. Weiner, a notoriously secretive writer and producer, is not telling anyone, of course. But he is saying that the seventh season of “Mad Men” will be its last. “That’s how long the show is,” Mr. Weiner said matter-of-factly on Thursday night, shortly after the announcement of his new contract. That gives the writers of “Mad Men” three more seasons to extend Don Draper’s suffering — or, just maybe, to resolve it. The contract announcement confirmed that the fifth season of “Mad Men” would have its premiere in early 2012, roughly six months later than previous seasons have started. AMC also affirmed that it would broadcast the sixth season of the show. The deal includes an option for Mr. Weiner and Lionsgate to make a seventh season, and Mr. Weiner indicated that he intended to act on that option. “I’m just thrilled I get to finish it,” he said in an interview on Thursday night. Negotiations among Mr. Weiner, AMC and the studio that makes “Mad Men,” Lionsgate, became testy this week when he protested proposed cuts to the cast budget and the length of the episodes. Mr. Weiner said Thursday that no cast cuts were mandated, and that he would produce 47-minute versions of each episode that could be viewed online, even if AMC broadcasted versions that were two minutes shorter. Making “Mad Men” a seven-season story is not a done deal. It hinges on the cast contracts that Lionsgate will have to negotiate, particularly with Jon Hamm, who plays Don Draper. He is signed only through the sixth season, according to an executive with knowledge of the negotiations, who insisted on anonymity because AMC and Lionsgate declined to comment beyond their statements. As television series age, “it’s always about keeping the cast going,” the executive said. Talk about the ending of any acclaimed show is rife with prickly issues. Mr. Weiner said he had tried not to be “emotionally attached to its future” and had always assumed that each season of “Mad Men” could be its last. But the negotiations for a new contract in March forced him to contemplate how long he would want the show to go on. Having an end date in mind, he said, “means I get to determine what taste will be left in the audience’s mouth.” But he added, “I’m still going to take it a season at a time, and work my way up to that.” ' \n",

Sure you do. (Me, I just look in the mirror.) “The Music Never Stopped’’ is about how one of those dads gets his comeuppance and realizes how lucky he is. Fictionalized from an actual medical case written about by neurologist Oliver Sacks in his early-’90s essay “The Last Hippie,’’ the movie is a drably directed yet terrifically affecting drama about family bonds, classic rock, and the human brain. It’s sentimental, yet so honest and eccentric that it rises above schmaltz. The reliable character actor J.K. Simmons (“Juno’’) tamps his energy down for a rare lead role as Henry Sawyer, a mechanical engineer who, when the film opens in 1986, is nearing retirement and stuck in a rut. Henry is a fusspot and a fanatic for the music of the pre-rock era — the big bands, the show tunes — and he has never forgiven his only child, Gabriel (Lou Taylor Pucci), for rebelling with Jimi and the Stones and Gabriel’s beloved Grateful Dead. Gone for 20 years, the prodigal son turns up in the hospital, his brain gutted by an enormous tumor. It’s removed and the prognosis is good, except that Gabriel can no longer form short-term memories. For him, the year is still 1970, that rat Nixon is still in office, and Dad remains the Man. Initially catatonic, Gabriel comes to life whenever music is played. To the delight of his therapist, Dianne (Julia Ormond), and the chagrin of his father, he responds tepidly to Bing Crosby yet ecstatically to the Beatles, to Cream, to the Dead’s “Uncle John’s Band.’’ It’s here that “The Music Never Stopped’’ ceases to be a curiously glum tale of intergenerational strife and turns into something strange and new. The only way for Henry to help Gabriel find himself — the only way he can be with his son — is to become a classic-rock junkie. This is a sight to see, warming and often hilarious, and I’m betting that Simmons read the script and thought of Richard Jenkins’s character in “The Visitor,’’ another frozen soul thawed by polyrhythms. The four corners of “The Music Never Stopped’’ are exquisitely acted, with Simmons gradually letting Henry’s freak flag fly, Pucci conveying the encyclopedic rock junkie inside the lost boy, Ormond showing the joy in professionalism, and Cara Seymour as Henry’s wife, Helen, gathering strength as her character finally becomes her own person. A really good director might have created a classic out of this. Jim Kohlberg, a producer (“Two Family House’’) making his behind-the-camera debut, moves the narrative along effectively but with zero visual style, and the hair and makeup in the flashback scenes are a disaster. He knows enough to get out of the story’s way, at least, and he’s very lucky to have a music supervisor, Susan Jacobs, who gets the right songs for the right scenes. (The bit where Gabriel explains “Desolation Row’’ to his father is a giddy highlight.) Not surprisingly, the prevailing vibe of “The Music Never Stopped’’ is set by “Ripple,’’ “Truckin’,’’ and other mellow, forgiving Grateful Dead warhorses. (The band’s Mickey Hart has been involved with this story from the very beginning.) That may draw you in or send you running for the hills. Whatever your musical tastes, though, the film’s a charmer with unexpected things to say about fathers and sons, the back roads of the brain, and the peculiar music fanaticism of so many otherwise mature men. It’s one to remember. Ty Burr can be reached at tburr@ globe.com, or followed at www.twitter.com/tyburr. ' \n",

Weiner, whose protracted contract negotiations with AMC became a major media story in recent days, planned to return to his office Friday to begin mapping out the season. The show, which normally runs in the summer, had already been pushed to early next year, in part because of the contract dispute. His writing staff will join him four to five weeks later, with production scheduled to begin in July. The show is set to return to the network's schedule in March of 2012. \"\"It's not desirable to be off the air this long,\"\" said Weiner, noting the more than 17-month gap between Seasons Four and Five, adding that he fought to get back on the air sooner but was resisted — and ultimately denied — by the network. While Weiner will be paid handsomely for staying with the show — people familiar with his contract say it is worth close to $10 million a season — money was not the main issue threatening his status. AMC had wanted to add commercials to \"\"Mad Men\"\" and Lionsgate wanted to cut talent to reduce costs in production of the expensive period drama. AMC had also wanted to pursue more product placement and product integration in the show to help recoup its costs. A compromise of sorts was reached on the commercials. The first and last episodes of the upcoming fifth season will run at 47 minutes and the rest of the episodes will run at 45 minutes. Weiner will have the option to make those other episodes at 47 minutes for other platforms including video on demand, DVD and iTunes. With regard to the cast, people close to the show said the main characters are all locked in for the next two seasons, which is how long AMC's current deal with Lionsgate for the show runs. Weiner said any cast changes will be made for creative reasons, not financial ones. A seventh season with Weiner onboard is likely unless AMC decides it is ready to move on from the series or the bulk of the cast is not renewed. \"\"I've never known, even the first season, if I was going to be back,\"\" he said. \"\"I'm still going to put everything I have into every episode, but seven seasons seems like the right length for the life of the show and I'm very excited knowing that I have that canvas to paint on.\"\" \"\"Mad Man\"\" won three Emmy Awards and helped boost AMC from an also-ran cable network to a first-tier channel. It now has other successful original shows including \"\"The Walking Dead\"\" and \"\"Breaking Bad\"\" and it has been able to boost both the dollars it attracts from advertisers and TV distributor fees.

A historian has claimed that a farmer buried in an unmarked tomb in Britain, could have been the outlaw who became the basis for the Robin Hood legend. David Baldwin, 64, claims that a grave in Warwickshire that is half covered in moss and with no headstone belongs to Roger Godberd, a 13th century farmer who committed burglaries, arson and murder like Robin Hood. He has written a book setting out the evidence in favour of his claim that Godberd was Robin Hood, and according to his research, Godberd lived from the early 1230s to the 1290s, led a gang of outlaws. Medieval court documents show that his band of men ranged across Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Wiltshire terrorising the wealthy and that he was eventually imprisoned for his crimes. He was even accused of poaching deer in Sherwood Forest along with his companion Walter Devyas - believed to be the Little John of popular legend. \"\"The story of Robin Hood is a mystery which has captured people's imaginations,\"\" the Daily Mail quoted Baldwin, a retired university lecturer and author from Leicester, as saying. \"\"Some of the individuals who have been identified as Robin in the past have something to be said for them but none are entirely convincing. \"\"Robin Hood is a composite character in that stories told of other outlaws have been borrowed over the years and added to his legend. \"\"There are probably several outlaws whose deeds have contributed to the modern-day stories of Robin Hood. \"\"But I believe there is one man whose career underpins the stories. His name is Roger Godberd and he was an outlaw who was active in the late 1260s. \"\"Quite a number of his activities seem to be replicated in the stories found in the earliest Robin Hood ballads. \"\"He poached deer in Sherwood Forest, was captured by the Sheriff of Nottingham, was imprisoned in Nottingham Castle and had the assistance of a friendly knight who helped him stay one step ahead of the law. \"\"He certainly robbed churchmen, just as the legendary Robin Hood did. \"\"It has been claimed that the legendary Robin Hood figure lived as early as the reign of Richard the Lionheart and as late as that of Edward II - a period of up to 140 years. \"\"But Walter Bower, one of the earliest writers to mention Robin Hood, says that he was forced into outlawry after being involved in Simon De Montfort's rebellion in the 1260s. \"\"Roger Godberd was one of Simon de Montfort's supporters which ties in with this very well. His name has been mentioned in some of earlier books about Robin, but the evidence has never been fully examined before,\"\" he said. After evading the authorities for years, Godberd was eventually captured in the early 1270s and jailed, but he was pardoned at his trial at the Tower of London and returned to his farm where he lived until his death. \"\"I believe Godberd's career inspired some of the early ballads, and I hope the book will encourage people to re-examine what they believe they know about Robin Hood,\"\" Baldwin added.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: '$9 million bequest offers &lsquo;stability&rsquo; Love, infidelity and stable finances are in the air at the Atlanta Opera, with Mozart’s subversive “Cosi Fan Tutte” opening Saturday, and with the realization that a recent $9 million bequest has opened a new chapter for the 31-year-old company. Alarming news has been frequent from across the local performing arts scene. The mighty Atlanta Symphony Orchestra groans under the weight of a debt beyond $8 million. The smaller Cobb Symphony issued an urgent plea to its patrons to bridge a budget gap of almost $50,000. Tiny arts groups across the region struggle to make payroll. But there have been a few breakthrough stories in recent years, such as the Atlanta Ballet’s big capital campaign, big endowment gifts and deluxe new dance studio. The Atlanta Opera was in financial hot water, too, until an unexpected bequest from the late Barbara D. Stewart, a corporate economist, arrived in February. Soon after, the opera sold out its run of “Porgy and Bess,” the cap to what might be remembered as the best month the company has ever had. Suddenly its future is looking as buoyant as its upcoming Mozart production at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre with four performances through April 17. “Cosi Fan Tutte” is the third and final production of the Atlanta Opera’s 2010-11 season. By the terms of Stewart’s will, half of the $9 million must go to the endowment, which brings the total to $5.4 million. (If the opera gets 5 percent interest off the endowment, that means $270,000 will be added to the budget annually.) The rest, general director Dennis Hanthorn says, will go into the checking account. “We haven’t actually received the money, but we’ll need it to replenish our cash reserves,” he said. “Our balance sheet has been weak, and we were known as a pay-as-you-go organization. These funds will help us cover the bills when cash is low, to cover the months between when a grant has been announced and when it’s actually paid.” He continued: “The funds won’t allow us to add another production — each costs about $600,000 — but it gives us stability. Her gift legitimizes the organization. Before, we’d be asked [by foundations and individual donors] ‘How long you gonna stay in business?’ Well, now we are not going out of business.” In addition to the opera’s $9 million, Stewart also left $1.5 million each to the High Museum of Art and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Although Stewart had been a steady patron of the arts over the decades, and had served on the Atlanta Opera’s board, Hanthorn was surprised by the size of the gift. “Barbara was a very modest person,” he said. “The Woodruff Arts Center wasn’t aware she’d give that much away. “I suspect few people knew she had that kind of money,” Hanthorn said, “and no one was suspecting that level of generosity for the arts in Atlanta. I’m humbled by it, and the best way we can honor her memory is to double or triple her bequest.” The other way to honor Stewart is to produce great opera. “Cosi Fan Tutte” is the third and most subtle, and slightly louche, of the trio of masterpiece operas Mozart composed with librettist Lorenzo da Ponte. Like “Marriage of Figaro” and “Don Giovanni,” “Cosi” is brought to a boil by the subject of sex that is risqué or unwelcome, depending on your perspective. The title is an imprecise translation from Italian meaning “all women are like that,” a bit of barbed chauvinism that sets the plot in motion. On a bet, two young soldiers test their fiancées’ fidelity. The girls are sisters, and to trick them each guy appears in disguise to woo the other’s betrothed. Dispiritingly, each soldier seems to have more chemistry with his pal’s gal than with his own. The seductions are successful. “‘Cosi Fan Tutte’ is a statement about how we lie to each other but really lie to ourselves,” said Carter Joseph, who has taught an Evenings at Emory class on the opera. “Historically, it opens the door to the end of the Enlightenment, where we’ve tried rational thought and it doesn’t work: Everyone is disillusioned at the end of the opera and our passions won out.” Many elements of the plot, however, would fit the pop culture of our own time. By classical convention, da Ponte’s unerringly brilliant libretto has all the action take place in a single day and in (mostly) one location, including spontaneous dual weddings at the end. “That sounds far-fetched and decadent, but Britney Spears got married for just a day,” Joseph pointed out. “The whole plot could be the premise for a reality television show. But the music is by Mozart, and he doesn’t pass judgments. He finds their humanity.” Pierre Ruhe is classical music critic of www.ArtsCriticATL.com. ' \n",

As world powers tighten their military and financial grip around his regime, some governments are hesitating to freeze all of the assets controlled by the North African country's repressive ruler. An Associated Press investigation has found that several European countries have accepted assurances from Libya's Tamoil petroleum company that none of its profits reach Tripoli. In return, Tamoil has been allowed to continue operating unchecked, despite the fact its parent company is on a United Nations sanctions list.

It would be naive to think that Tamoil is independent,\"\" said Zurich-based money-laundering expert Michael Alkalay. He said Western governments that readily did business with Libya in recent years now criticize Gadhafi's regime but are doing little to clamp down on its assets, the most visible of which is Tamoil whose logo fronts gas stations from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean. Gary Hufbauer, a former U.S. Treasury deputy assistant secretary in the Carter administration, said European governments _ which like the U.S. have frozen Libyan cash deposits in their banks _ are essentially taking Tamoil's word for it that the profits won't get back to Gadhafi. \"\"If the Europeans are serious about imposing the freeze, they shouldn't be allowing any money to be paid if it's going to any part of the Libyan regime,\"\" said Hufbauer, now a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. World powers intentionally stopped short of naming Tamoil in their sanctions lists, he said, citing its importance to Europe. The company's Swiss branch is registered in the southwestern town of Collombey-Muraz, where it operates a 72,000 barrels-per-day refinery that supplies more than 300 gas stations throughout Switzerland. Sister companies in Spain, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy operate 2,500 more gas stations, and there are two other refineries in Hamburg, Germany, and Cremona, Italy. The refineries' combined capacity is 255,000 barrels of crude oil a day, or about 2 percent of the 14 million barrels that power Europe daily. Libya was producing 1.58 million barrels a day of crude oil in January, according to International Energy Agency figures. All are part of a Dutch-based holding company, Oilinvest (Netherlands) B.V., whose sales ran to some $10 billion in 2009. Oilinvest, in turn, is owned by the Libyan Investment Authority, the country's sovereign wealth fund estimated to be worth $65 billion. Last month, the LIA was placed under international sanctions on the grounds that it is controlled by Gadhafi or persons close to him. Tamoil's links to the regime, however, aren't enough for Switzerland to shut it down, according to the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, or SECO. \"\"Tamoil has pledged in writing to SECO to fully respect the sanctions imposed by the Swiss Federal Council, in particular not to make any payments or transfer other assets, in whichever form, to natural or legal persons who are subject to sanctions,\"\" spokeswoman Antje Baertschi told AP. She acknowledged that Switzerland isn't checking whether Tamoil is living up to its pledge, nor could she say when Tamoil made its last payment to Libya. \"\"It's not possible to monitor all transactions,\"\" she said. A spokesman for Germany's Economy Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Berlin was satisfied Tamoil would comply with international sanctions after receiving written assurances. Monitoring compliance was a matter for the prosecutors, he said. But in a sign that some Tamoil entities are prepared to go further to protect their operations, the company's German spokeswoman, Bedi, said an external auditor would be given access to its books. Meanwhile, Italy's Finance Ministry said in a statement last week that \"\"no freezing measure has been adopted toward Tamoil Italia S.p.a,\"\" which it said was \"\"collaborating with the authorities to ensure the adopted international sanctions are respected fully regarding the situation in Libya.\"\" Charles Huyskens, a spokesman for Tamoil's branch in the Netherlands, told AP the company had struck a deal with the Dutch government. \"\"The operation here is business as usual, but the guarantee is that they will not transfer money abroad or to any shareholder or whatever,\"\" he said. Finance Ministry spokesman Niels Redeker disputed this, saying the government was still in talks with Tamoil \"\"to prevent (cash) reserves from reaching entities on the banned list. But these are talks and have not led to any agreement.\"\" Dutch opposition lawmaker Harry van Bommel said Tamoil's many shell companies in tax havens _ from Monaco to Curacao in the Caribbean _ make it impossible to guard against Gadhafi's allies funneling money out of the company. \"\"All assets of Tamoil should be frozen, period,\"\" he said. \"\"We're talking about U.N. resolutions, we're talking about Gadhafi who is willing to kill his own people. Would he not ask a company under his control to transfer assets?\"\" U.S. sanctions apply to anything owned or controlled by the government of Libya, which would include Tamoil if it did business with or processed payments through the U.S., said a senior U.S. Treasury Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. After Libya agreed to scrap its secret nuclear weapons program and compensate victims of terrorist attacks, the U.S. in 2006 rescinded its designation as a state sponsor of terrorism. And with the country emerging from international isolation, western firms rushed to sign oil exploration deals. Libya's more than 46 billion barrels of oil reserves are the largest in Africa and all but five percent of its exports come from oil. Flush with petrodollars, Libya invested heavily in foreign assets, from Spanish banks to Italian football clubs, and a growing network of petroleum companies in the long chain stretching from supplier to consumer. EU documents show that the 27-nation bloc has used financial sanctions against Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea, Yugoslavia, Zimbabwe as well as Libya. In recent years there have been increasing calls for \"\"targeted\"\" financial sanctions that aim to freeze a person or a company's profits, rather than shut it down and cause broader economic distress. Enrico Carisch, a U.S.-based Swiss field investigator who has worked for the U.N. enforcing sanctions against Somalia, Liberia, Congo and Sudan, said Tamoil's profits should be frozen rather than simply shut down. \"\"Every government has to conduct due diligence to make sure they are not inadvertently contributing to the problem,\"\" he said. \"\"The enemy is not Libyan workers, the enemy is not Libyan companies. The enemy is those who derive benefits from the Libyan oil and use them against the Libyan people.\"\" One argument for keeping Tamoil afloat is that any future government in Libya would be entitled to reclaim ownership over the company on behalf of ordinary Libyans. An attempt by Los Angeles-based private investment firm Colony Capital LLC in 2007 to buy a 65 percent stake in Tamoil and Oilinvest from the Libyan government valued the entire company at over $8 billion. The deal never came off. Sven Behrendt, a Geneva-based expert on sovereign wealth funds, said Tamoil may only be the most visible tip of the Libyan Investment Authority's assets. He recently ranked the LIA among the least transparent of some two dozen sovereign wealth funds, making it difficult for governments to fully know what it owns or controls. The most immediate threat to the company's operations may be its rivals. Royal Dutch Shell has halted a supply agreement with Tamoil in the Netherlands, citing the international sanctions. The parties are due in court next week. Meanwhile, a monthlong maintenance period at the Swiss refinery has been brought forward to April due to \"\"uneconomical margins,\"\" a spokesman there said. ___ ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Vodafone lifts Essar stake by 33% Vodafone will buy an additional 33 percent stake in its Indian joint venture for $5 billion (R34bn) after its partner, Essar, exercised an option to sell the holding in India’s third-largest cellular operator. The deal will raise Vodafone’s stake to 75 percent. Essar would exit the company after it implemented a put option over 22 percent of the venture, Vodafone said yesterday, while the British company exercised its call option to buy another 11 percent stake. The deal is a boost for Vodafone chief executive Vittorio Colao as Essar failed to gain a higher valuation for part of its stake in Vodafone Essar. Founded by billionaires Shashi and Ravi Ruia, Essar had an option to sell its entire 33 percent stake for $5bn to Vodafone or to sell a smaller stake at an independently appraised fair market value. “The advantage for Vodafone is that they don’t have to consider the other shareholder now,” said Macquarie Securities analyst Guy Peddy. Vodafone had already set aside the $5bn cash payment within its net debt of £30bn (R328bn). The deal would increase Vodafone’s direct equity stake in the venture to 75 percent, spokesman Ben Padovan said. The company would comply with local rules, he added. India does not allow foreign companies to own more than 74 percent in local cellular operators. “They’ll have to sell that 1 percent to some Indian entity, or they’ll have to consider an initial public offering (IPO),” said MF Global analyst Naveen Kulkarni in Mumbai. Vodafone said the deal was predicted to be completed no later than November this year. Essar spokesmen Manish Kedia and Rabin Ghosh did not respond to calls for comment. Vodafone is increasing its stake in the venture in one of its fastest growing markets. India was one of the “jewels” in the three months to December, Colao said in February. While Vodafone is expanding in India, it is seeking to exit from French cellular operator SFR, in which it holds a 44 percent stake. Vivendi, which owns the rest, has said it wanted full control of the unit. Colao, who last year sold Vodafone’s $6.5bn stake in China Mobile in his biggest divestment since he took charge in 2008, is reviewing all the company’s minority interests amid pressure from shareholders to squeeze more out of the investments. Last year bankers had valued Vodafone Essar at between $13bn and $18bn when Essar was considering an IPO for the Indian venture, a source said earlier this year. That would have valued Essar’s stake at between $4.3bn and $6bn. Vodafone bought 67 percent of Hutchison Essar for $10.7bn in 2007. Its outlook for India soured a year after its entry, when six new national licences were awarded. Vodafone took a $3.3bn charge for the Indian unit last May, citing “intense price competition”. Since then, Vodafone’s service revenue from India increased by 17 percent in the financial third quarter. The Indian cellular market is forecast by Gartner in the US to exceed 993 million users by the end of 2014. Standard Chartered advised the Essar Group on the transaction, and Vodafone used Goldman Sachs. UBS was hired as a third investment bank to help reach a valuation of the Indian joint venture. – Bloomberg ' \n",

Despite a successful Portuguese debt sale on Friday, Fitch slashed its rating to the lowest investment grade rank of BBB-. \"\"The severity of the downgrade by three notches mainly reflects Fitch's concern that timely external support is much less likely in the near term following yesterday's announcement of general elections to take place on 5 June,\"\" said Douglas Renwick, Director in Fitch's Sovereign Ratings Group. \"\"The agency views external support as necessary to bolster the credibility of Portugal's fiscal consolidation and economic reform effort, as well as secure its financing position,\"\" Renwick said in a statement. [ID:nN01238604] Earlier Standard & Poor's became the last of the three major rating agencies to strip Ireland of its \"\"A\"\" rating. However, the one notch cut and stable outlook was less severe than feared and it gave the thumbs up to stress tests which on Thursday showed its four troubled banks needed a further 24 billion euros to be properly capitalised. [ID:nLDE72T20R] <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Stories on Portugal's debt crisis: [ID:nLDE68T0MG] Euro zone struggles with debt: r.reuters.com/hyb65p Interactive timeline on crisis: link.reuters.com/can23r ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^> Portugal sold 1.645 billion euros of short-dated bonds on Friday, but had to offer an interest rate of 5.79 percent, lower than other current market rates but 2.5 percentage points more than it paid at similar auctions last year. [ID:nLDE7300QU] Lisbon is now having to pay a higher interest rate to borrow money for the next 15 months than Spain is paying to raise funds for 10 years - a clear indication of how much risk investors now attach to Portugal. Portugal's 10-year bond yields went on rising despite the smooth auction, hitting 8.77 percent, up more than a percentage point in the past week. Ireland's reached 10.1 percent, nearly 6.5 percentage points higher than benchmark German Bunds. Richard McGuire, a debt strategist at Rabobank, said that while Friday's auction showed Lisbon could still tap the markets if needed, the trend was bleak. \"\"(Portugal) is fundamentally insolvent - i.e. it is clearly in a situation where debt will have to be issued to cover servicing costs, thereby resulting in a snowballing of liabilities,\"\" he said. S&P, whose rubbishing of a previous \"\"final bill\"\" for Ireland's banking sector sent the country's debt crisis into overdrive last year, said the assumptions underlying the latest round of tests of bank resilience were robust. But rival agency Fitch took the shine off S&P's modest downgrade when it warned it could cut its BBB+ rating on the back of weaker growth and a jump in the bank bailout costs. A Reuters poll of economists gave a consensus forecast of just 0.5 percent growth in Ireland this year, well below the official forecast of 1.7 percent and weaker than the 0.9 percent pencilled in by the European Commission and IMF. GREEK MEMORIES Underscoring the tenuous nature of Portugal's finances, the statistics agency had to restate the 2010 budget deficit on Thursday, increasing the shortfall to 8.6 percent of gross domestic product from 7.3 percent. [ID:nLDE72U17E] The adjustment was down to methodology and will not affect 2011 figures, but still undermines broader confidence, reviving memories of the Greek deficit revision of 2009 that lit the fuse of the euro zone debt crisis. Financial markets are convinced Lisbon will have to ask the European Union and International Monetary Fund for a bailout. However, caretaker Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, who resigned last week after parliament rejected his latest spending cuts, has made it a point of honour not to accept EU/IMF help. Portugal's president dissolved parliament on Thursday and set June 5 as the date for the next polls, meaning the country is effectively in limbo for two more months. While Portugal can probably go on funding itself for the next eight weeks - it has to refinance 4.3 billion euros ($6.1 billion) of debt in April and 4.9 billion in June - the cost of doing so is likely to go on being punitively high. IRISH BANK BILL The debt crisis in the euro zone has already consumed Greece and Ireland and shows few signs of relenting. The 24 billion euros extra bank bill for Ireland, which received an 85 billion euro package of aid from the EU and IMF in November, was in line with market expectations and, coupled with the European Central Bank's decision to suspend collateral requirements for loans from Ireland, gave the Irish banking sector a lift on Friday. [ID:nLDE7300KK] [ID:nLDE72U1QQ] The European Commission said it believed the stress tests had been \"\"extremely rigorous\"\" and that there should now be no more surprises lurking for the financial markets. But Ireland still has accumulated bank liabilities of nearly 45 percent of GDP and will have total debts of well over 100 percent of GDP if forecasts from the stress tests are right. If the European Central Bank raises interest rates next week as expected, the impact on growth will be even greater in both Ireland and Portugal, driving up debt-to-GDP ratios without the debt increasing.

This Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) is still cheap, trading at just 11 times forward estimates. Kraton manufactures engineered polymers and styrenic block copolymers (SBCs). These products are used across a wide range of products such as adhesives, coatings, personal care products, sealants and lubricants, footwear products, paving and roofing products. It is a global company with customers in over 60 countries and manufacturing facilities in 5 plants in Germany, France, Brazil, Japan and Ohio. Kraton Surprised By 7.3% Special Offer : Curtis Hesler told his subscribers to buy Silver Wheaton (SLW) at $4 in 2008. It hit $42 in December. Nice score…but what now, back up the truck or bail while you still can? Click here for an important new alert in Professional Timing Service . On March 2, Kraton reported its fourth quarter results and surprised by 3 cents a share. Earnings per share were 44 cents compared to the 41 cents consensus. The company lost 7 cents in the year ago period. This was the 4th consecutive beat but the company only went public in the fourth quarter of 2009 so there is a limited earnings history. Still, it’s a nice track record to start out beating 4 out of 5 quarters. Sales jumped 21% to $288 million mainly due to higher sales volume which rose 10% and price increases put into affect in response to rising raw material costs. Revenue rose in each of the company’s segments with the largest, Advanced Materials, seeing a 23% gain to $92 million. Even the Paving and Roofing segment saw growth of 31% to $64 million, boosted by increased roofing volume in Europe, of all places, and even in North America. Price increases were enacted to offset higher monomer costs. Paving was weaker, however, especially in North America where there was a lack of funding for infrastructure projects. For the full year, sales volume climbed 18% and revenue soared 33% to $1.2 billion versus 2009. The revenue increase was again driven by higher sales volume and higher prices, boosted by rising material costs. Growth Expected to Continue in 2011 Kraton is bullish on 2011. Based on existing trends, it expects first quarter sales volume to be 5% to 7% higher than the first quarter of 2010. It also believes the pricing for its 3 primary feedstocks, on average, will be higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Zacks Consensus Estimates Jump Given the optimistic outlook, analysts moved to raise 2011 and 2012 estimates. In the last month, 4 estimates were revised higher for 2011, pushing the Zacks Consensus up to $3.76 from $3.56 per share. That is earnings growth of 15.4% in 2011. 2 estimates have also moved higher for 2012 in the last 30 days. Analysts expect earnings of $4.20 in 2012, which is earnings growth of 11.6%. Still Value in the Shares Even with shares at new 52-week highs, Kraton still has attractive valuations. In addition to a low forward P/E, the company has a price-to-book ratio of 2.8.

Mike Brown's attorney Ed Swanson just sent us the following statement from Mike Brown, acknowledging that he bought the shares and defending his intentions: \"\"False and damaging information has been published about my actions and in the interest of defending my character I feel it is necessary to make a statement. I did buy Facebook stock on the secondary market in early September 2010, and I did so with the absolute best of intentions and only because I believe in Facebook. As for any allegations regarding the Goldman Sachs /Facebook transaction, I had absolutely no knowledge of that transaction until it appeared in the press in January 2011. I am saddened by the course of events that led to my departure and the incorrect reporting of it. I am now focused on moving on past this unfortunate series of events.\"\" Facebook can monitor whether its employees are purchasing shares - every time its shares are sold in the secondary market as a private placement Facebook has right of first refusal. A source at a platform that trades these shares tells me Facebook is meticulous, and certainly would take note of an employee name on a transaction. So if Brown had gone to SecondMarket, his request to trade likely would have been rejected. That means Brown likely bought his shares through a private company fund, of which there are several, run by SharesPost, Felix, and Wedbush. This shines the spotlight on funds of private company shares as an area where the SEC is likely to really crack down. These funds make private shares far more like securities, and when it comes to insider trading they're far harder for companies to monitor than individual transactions.

And in Philadelphia, manufacturers like Boathouse Sports are starting to overtake their Asian competitors and start hiring again. \"\"As we look into the next quarter and beyond, we will be adding additional staff,\"\" said Douglas Tibbets, president and CEO of Boathouse Sports. The news is good, but the reality for so many others remains grim. All told, 13 million Americans still don't have work. That figure is equivalent to the population of Illinois. One of those Americans, Joseph Cappelluzzo, has been out of a job for two years. The father of five from Florida has gone to extreme measures to find work, even standing by the side of the road with a sign. Today, Cappelluzzo has worked enough odd jobs to buy a new house for his family, but he still has no stable employer. \"\"I'm working six and a half days a week,\"\" Cappelluzzo said. \"\"I'd work in a bar. I would work in a Laundromat. I would do whatever it took to feed my family.\"\" ' \n",

The part-nationalised bank's market share in some retail segments is almost double that of its nearest competitor, but there has been no assessment of the impact its standing has had on competition, according to a report from the Treasury Select Committee. The Commons committee added that the European Union-imposed sale of 600 Lloyds branches may not be enough to address competition concerns, and said a public interest test based on competition should apply to the divestment and future sell-offs. The committee's report, which concluded that competition in the sector is not working, comes ahead of the keenly awaited spring report from the Independent Commission on Banking (ICB), due on April 11. The ICB is believed to be drawing up a radical approach to reforming the industry, which could include a recommendation to split banks between investment and retail arms. It has also been looking at a potential break-up of Lloyds following its rescue takeover of HBOS, which was rushed through at the height of the financial crisis. The Treasury Select Committee took evidence from a wide range of banking industry figures including former Lloyds chief executive Eric Daniels, Barclays boss Bob Diamond and Royal Bank of Scotland head Stephen Hester. The committee's report also claimed the sale of more than 300 Royal Bank of Scotland branches to rival Santander was a missed opportunity to inject more competition into the retail banking sector. The committee also found a lack of price transparency in the current account market as well as difficulty in switching accounts, with committee chairman Andrew Tyrie saying: \"\"For competition to be effective, customers need to know what they are buying, how much they are paying and to be able to transfer their custom from one provider to another without risk.\"\" He added: \"\"The chief executives of the large incumbents told the committee UK retail banking was enormously competitive, but a far larger range of witnesses described the industry as close to an oligopoly. \"\"We also received much evidence about low levels of consumer satisfaction and poor treatment of consumers by the major banks. We could not but conclude from this that competition in the UK retail banking market is not strong enough.\"\" ' \n",

Reporting from Washington and Los Angeles— The nation's job-creation engine revved up last month and pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in two years, spreading optimism that the economic recovery is firmly in place and giving President Obama a political boost. The economy lured back unemployed Americans who had given up hope of getting another paycheck as increases across nearly all sectors led to 216,000 additional jobs, the Labor Department said. The unemployment rate ticked down to 8.8% — a full percentage point lower than in November and the sharpest four-month drop in 28 years. Obama, trying to fend off a Republican push for deep budget cuts that administration officials warn could derail the recovery, said Friday that the economy was showing \"\"signs of real strength.\"\" But he cautioned that millions of Americans still are out of work and that \"\"we have to keep the momentum going.\"\" The improvement bettered economists' predictions of about 200,000 new jobs and led forecasters to say that strong job growth appeared to have taken hold. Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York, said there was \"\"powerful forward momentum\"\" in the jobs market, which should help buffet the headwind on the economy from rising gasoline prices. That price rise, as well as uncertainty over the Middle East and debt-burdened economies in Europe, might yet cause the economy to slow again. But the favorable jobs report had an immediate effect on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose Friday to nearly 12,377, and on the political scene, where Republicans could find it difficult to push their conservative agenda in Congress. Republicans have said that employers aren't hiring because of overregulation, overspending and the new healthcare law, and that the economic recovery requires a change of direction. As businesses start hiring again, that argument weakens. Republicans also could find it tougher to push for deep budget cuts as public-sector job losses continue to be one of the few major drags on employment. The GOP won big in elections last fall at a time when some economists predicted unemployment might hit double digits this year. Amid worries about the economy, Obama's reelection prospects dimmed. But his standing in opinion polls has improved. And partly because of continued economic recovery, national polls show his reelection prospects now are as good or better after a little more than two years in office than Bill Clinton's or George W. Bush's, both of whom won second terms. At this point, Obama's presidency is tracking closer to that of Ronald Reagan, who rode an economic rebound to victory, than to Jimmy Carter, who was bounced after one term because of economic woes. \"\"Reagan's rise from a pretty unfavorable position…was built on a dramatic improvement in jobs numbers in \"\"83 and \"\"84,\"\" said Carroll Doherty, associate director of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. During that two-year period, the unemployment rate fell from 10.4% to 7.2%. The recent drop in the unemployment rate from 9.8% in November is the best since then. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) downplayed the job growth, describing it as an \"\"uptick.\"\" While acknowledging it was good news, he said the still-high unemployment showed Republicans \"\"need to continue our efforts in Washington to foster pro-growth policies that will help businesses small and large to innovate and expand.\"\" White House officials were delighted by the new numbers, which they said surpassed their own internal projections. \"\"Obviously, things can go wrong, but this continues to be a very solid trend that we've seen over the last year,\"\" said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors. \"\"Yes, it was a deep hole, but we're growing our way out of that hole.\"\" Optimism also has spread to unemployed workers, such as 37-year-old Air Force veteran Matthew Mabry of Bakersfield. On Thursday, he signed up for job-search help from Jewish Vocational Services. ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Google founder hopes to prove he's ready to lead Larry Page takes over as CEO Mon., replacing Eric Schmidt, a veteran Silicon Valley executive (AP) SAN FRANCISCO - Google co-founder Larry Page is known for his vision, passion and intelligence. Yet there is a fair amount of concern that Page's other known traits  his aloofness, rebellious streak and affinity for pursuing wacky ideas  might lead the company astray. Page takes over as CEO on Monday as fast-rising rivals and tougher regulators threaten Google's growth. Investors used to Google Inc.\"\"s consistency in exceeding financial targets worry that new leadership will bring more emphasis on long-term projects that take years to pay off. And many people still aren't sure he has enough management skills to steer the Internet's most powerful company. Page already has learned that smarts alone won't make him a great leader. Although Page impressed Google's early investors with his ingenuity, they still insisted that he step down in 2001 as Google's first CEO. He turned over the job to Eric Schmidt, a veteran executive who began working in Silicon Valley in the early 1980s while Page was still in grammar school. Gmail Motion: Google's revolutionary new technology Page's admirers say that at 38, he is more mature and less apt to be chronically late to meetings or tune out of conversations that don't stimulate his intellect  habits that he fell into during his first stint as CEO. \"\"There are parts of being CEO that don't fit Larry's personality,\"\" said Craig Silverstein, the first employee that Page and Google's other founder, Sergey Brin, hired when they started the company in 1998. \"\"You wear a lot of different hats when you're CEO. Some of them are very interesting to Larry and some of them, presumably, are less interesting.\"\" True to his taciturn form, Page hasn't said much publicly since Google made its stunning announcement in January that he will replace Schmidt as CEO. Google said Page wasn't available for an interview. Page, though, has left little doubt about his top priority: to dissolve the bureaucracy and complacency that accompanied the company's rapid transformation into a 21st-century empire. Google is expected to end the year with more than 30,000 employees and $35 billion in annual revenue. In Page's mind, the 13-year-old company needs to return to thinking and acting like a feisty startup. Rising Internet stars such as Facebook, Twitter and Groupon, all less than 8 years old, are developing products that could challenge Google and make its dominance of Internet search less lucrative. Page has drawn comparisons to two high-tech geniuses who are even more accomplished: Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs. Like those two pioneers in personal technology, Page invented and cultivated a product that changed the world. But Page has yet to match them in this respect: as CEOs, Gates and Jobs brought out the best in the companies that they created, delighting stockholders as their investments soared. Page doesn't fit the CEO mold, even by the standards of Silicon Valley's free-wheeling culture. He dropped out of graduate school at Stanford to start Google and doesn't have a business degree. Science and technology, though, seems to be in his DNA even though he grew up in Michigan, where automobiles rule. His late father, Carl, was a computer scientist and pioneer in artificial intelligence, and his mother taught computer programming. Page began working on personal computers when he was just 6 years old in 1979, when home computers were a rarity. The geeky impulses carried into his adulthood, leading him to once build an inkjet printer out of Legos. Page relishes challenging the status quo and encourages his employees to do so, too. Those who know Page suspect he picked up the anti-establishment mindset as a boy who attended Montessori schools, which discourage structured curricula and encourage independent activities. Page has wanted to control his own destiny  and legacy  since reading a biography of the inventor Nikola Tesla before he was even in high school. Tesla wasn't rewarded or widely recognized for his breakthroughs in X-ray, wireless communications and electricity. Page didn't want that to happen to him as an entrepreneur. For that reason, Page embraced the chance to be Google's CEO when the company started in a rented garage not far from the company's current headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. It also helps explain why he and Brin created a separate class of stock with greater voting power so they and Schmidt could remain in charge after the company went public in 2004. Page's stake in Google has made him one of the world's wealthiest people with an estimated fortune of $20 billion. Although the contours of his personality and background are known quantities, Page remains an enigmatic figure on Wall Street. To some, he remains best known for uncompromising idealism, reflected in his embrace of his company's \"\"Don't Be Evil\"\" motto and his pledge to never cater to investors\"\" desire for ever-rising quarterly earnings at the expense of long-term investments. Page already raised concerns by pushing Google into renewable energy and robotic cars. Those who know him say he has discussed even more far-flung projects behind closed doors. \"\"Sometimes his ideas are just way out there and you're kind of like, \"\"Wow, that came out of left field,\"\"\"\" said Ethan Anderson, a former Google product manager who now runs Redbeacon, a startup that operates a search engine for finding neighborhood businesses. Uncertainty about whether Page will be as interested as Schmidt in appeasing Wall Street has contributed to a 6 percent drop in Google's stock price since the CEO change was announced Jan. 20. The technology-driven Nasdaq index has added 3 percent during that time. BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis doesn't believe it's a coincidence that Google revealed it would hire more than 6,200 employees this year  a 25 percent boost, and the most in its history  less than a week after it announced Page's comeback as CEO. \"\"Don't be surprised if Google's spending goes up, even it means its earnings per share might go down,\"\" Gillis said. Page's supporters believe Google's current market value of about $190 billion will climb even higher under his leadership. That would mirror what happened after Jobs finally got his chance to run Apple in 1997 after a decade in exile. Since then, Apple has brought out the iconic iPod, iPhone and iPad devices and created more than $300 billion in shareholder wealth. But the returns of company founders haven't always been triumphant. Consider Yahoo Inc. co-founder Jerry Yang's second stint as CEO from June 2007 to January 2009. Yahoo's stock fell 56 percent during that period, larger than the 41 percent drop for Nasdaq. Unlike the rest of the Nasdaq, Yahoo shares aren't close to rebounding to their June 2007 levels. Hoping to smooth the transition to a new CEO, Google is keeping Schmidt, 55, in a prominent role as executive chairman and chief liaison with lawmakers and regulators around the world. That's an important job as Google faces growing scrutiny over its ambitions to use its dominance in search to enter new markets. Brin, 37, intends to focus on long-term projects, leaving Page to manage Google's daily operations. \"\"I am quite convinced that this change will result in faster decision-making, better success for the business and ultimately greater value for the shareholders,\"\" Schmidt told The Associated Press after Google announced its shake-up in January. In the past, the three made key decisions by committee, though Schmidt was the one responsible as CEO. Schmidt guided Google through an uninterrupted stretch of prosperity that has topped the performances of other technology trailblazers, including Apple and Microsoft, at similar stages of their corporate lives. Page is better prepared to be CEO after a decade as Schmidt's apprentice, said Douglas Merrill, who worked with both executives before leaving Google in 2008 as vice president of engineering. \"\"Larry has grown over time,\"\" Merrill said. \"\"He has learned how to make projects work. He has learned how to make sure things happen on time and in a predictable fashion. Larry is a sort of a learning machine.\"\" ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Jobless rate falls to 8.8% Washington • The nation's unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level in two years in March, and the outlook is brightening as major companies plan to add more jobs. Increased hiring cut the unemployment rate to 8.8 percent - an encouraging sign for the unemployed and for President Barack Obama's re-election prospects. Still, the job gains haven't led many people who stopped looking for work during the recession to start again. Fewer than two-thirds of American adults are either working or looking for work - the lowest participation rate in 25 years. The economy added 216,000 jobs last month, the government said Friday. Factories, retailers, the education and health care sectors, and professional and financial services all expanded payrolls. Those gains offset layoffs by local governments, construction and telecommunications. The improved outlook propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to a 2011 high in early trading. Stocks then pared their gains as oil prices climbed to 30-month highs. The Dow closed up about 57 points. The private sector added more than 200,000 jobs for a second straight month. It was the first time that's happened since 2006 - more than a year before the recession started. And it could mark a turning point in job creation. America's largest companies plan to step up hiring in the next six months, a March survey of CEOs found. Google, Siemens Corp. and Ford Motor Co., among others, have said they plan to add workers. Economists expect the stronger hiring to endure throughout the year, producing a net gain of about 2.5 million jobs for 2011. Even so, that would make up for only a small portion of the 7.5 million jobs wiped out during the recession. The economy must average up to 300,000 new jobs a month to significantly lower unemployment. Story continues below The unemployment rate has fallen a full percentage point since November, the sharpest four-month drop since 1983. Stepped-up hiring is the main reason. But a more sobering factor is that the number of people who are either working or seeking a job remains surprisingly low for this stage of the recovery. People without jobs who aren't looking for one aren't counted as unemployed. Once they start looking again, they're classified as unemployed, and the unemployment rate can go back up. That can happen even if the economy is adding jobs. Just 64.2 percent of adults have a job or are looking for one - the lowest participation rate since 1984. The number has been shrinking for four years. It suggests many people remain discouraged about their job prospects even as hiring is picking up. A falling unemployment rate is vital for Obama, who is 19 months from a re-election vote and facing a lineup of potential Republican challengers who will make his stewardship of the economy the dominant issue. President Ronald Reagan had low job-approval ratings in his first term, when unemployment surged to 10.4 percent. By Election Day 1984, the unemployment rate had sunk to 7.2 percent. Reagan won a landslide victory. \"\"Although we got good news today, we have to keep the momentum going,\"\" Obama told workers at a UPS shipping facility in suburban Maryland. \"\"There are still millions of Americans out there that are looking for a job that pays the bills.\"\" Just 15 percent of Americans surveyed in mid-March said the economy had improved in the past month, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll. That's a sharp decline from January, when 30 percent said so. And 28 percent said the economy would worsen. It's the largest percentage to say so since the question was first asked in December 2009.

The teacher, who has not been publicly identified, was suspended with pay from her position at School 21 after parents complained to the school and asked that their children be removed from her class, district officials told The Record of North Jersey. Terry Corallo, a spokeswoman for the Paterson district, e-mailed a statement on Friday confirming that the teacher was on paid administrative leave, adding that “this matter is a personnel issue that is under investigation.” On Friday, the teacher declined through her lawyer, Nancy Oxfeld, to comment. Ms. Oxfeld said any comments that the teacher had made on Facebook were done on her own time and to her friends. “My feeling is that if you’re concerned about children, you’re concerned about what goes on in the classroom, not about policing your employee’s private comments to others,” Ms. Oxfeld said. Ms. Oxfeld, who was contacted through the New Jersey Education Association, declined to give her client’s name. Word of the Facebook comment spread across Paterson and beyond, and spurred e-mail exchanges, water-cooler gossip and more postings on Facebook. Irene Sterling, president of the Paterson Education Fund, a nonprofit group that supports the local school community, said parents were angry about the teacher’s comments because anyone, including her own students, could have read the negative characterizations. She said it highlighted a lack of commitment by some teachers. “It’s horrible,” she said. “And unfortunately, I don’t think she’s the only teacher in Paterson who thinks that way.” The Paterson district, with 28,000 students and 2,425 teachers, has long been one of New Jersey’s most troubled school systems; it was taken over by the state in 1991 because of fiscal mismanagement and poor academic performance. In a similar episode, a high school English teacher in Doylestown, Pa., was suspended recently after she called students “disengaged, lazy whiners” on her blog. Jonathan Zimmerman, a New York University history professor who has written about education, said teachers, like other professionals, had responsibilities. He compared the episodes to a doctor talking loudly about cases on a crowded train. “It seems to me with professional responsibility comes a duty to exercise discretion,” he said. ' \n",

The US Labour Department said non-farm payrolls rose by 216,000 compared with economists' estimates of a rise of 195,000. The February figure was revised upward to 194,000 from an estimate of 192,000, while the unemployment rate fell to a two-year low of 8.8 per cent from 8.9 per cent a month ago. \"\"The jobs data shows the economy is improving and demand should remain strong,\"\" said Andy Lebow, senior vice-president at brokerage MF Global. Light, sweet crude oil for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled higher by $US1.22, or 1.1 per cent, at $US107.94 a barrel. That was the highest level since September 25, 2008. The contract hit an intra-day high of $US108.05 a barrel in the final minutes of trading for the week. Front-month May ICE North Sea Brent crude settled at $US118.70 a barrel, the highest price since August 21, 2008, and up $US1.34 on the day. Traders said chart patterns suggest Nymex crude can easily make a run for $US110 a barrel and beyond. The rally fed upon itself as prices responded to US-dollar weakness. Rich Ilczyszyn, a broker at Lind-Waldock said: \"\"A lot of players are looking at this market and saying, \"\"Do I really want to go home short oil?\"\" \"\" The US dollar shed early strength after William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said it wasn't time yet to \"\"reverse course\"\" and tighten monetary policy amid a \"\"tenuous\"\" US recovery, in contrast to recent hawkish comments from other Fed officials. A weaker US dollar generally makes crude oil cheaper for investors using foreign currencies. Still, Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics, said the improving US economic conditions mean the time is drawing nearer when the Fed will begin to slowly tighten policy. \"\"We will not be going from an accommodative to an austere policy, but to a slightly less accommodative policy,\"\" around the middle of 2012, he predicted. Higher rates would come in response to stronger economic growth, which would underpin oil prices or support further gains, he said, while continued improvement in the jobs situation would help insulate consumers against rising gasoline prices. Traders said a strong infusion of new investment from commodity funds at the start of the second quarter helped drive gains against a backdrop of uncertainty surrounding the on-going Libyan civil war and lingering concerns over the potential for civil unrest elsewhere in the Middle East, the global oil patch. A Libyan rebel leader said his forces are ready for a ceasefire, provided Muammar Gaddafi's forces end their assaults on rebel-held cities, but there wasn't any immediate sign that would take place. Rebels said also they had reached a deal in which Qatar will market crude from rebel-held areas, in exchange for food, medicine, and funds to buy weapons. Oil exports of 1 million barrels per week could come from the Sarir oilfield once vessels are available to transport it, the rebels said. Prior to the unrest, begun in mid-February, Libya was pumping about 2 per cent of global oil supplies, and exporting about 1m bpd. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter has boosted output to offset the shortfall and is offering similar-quality crude to Libyan customers in Europe. Traders noted that the higher prices come as US oil supplies remain high. Crude oil inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma - the delivery point for the Nymex contract - stand at a record high and are 35 per cent higher than supplies from a year ago. That has kept the US benchmark depressed relative to Brent crude, which traders said better reflects strong global demand. US gasoline inventories are sufficient to cover 24.5 days of current demand, compared with a five-year average of 24.1 days, even as retail prices stand at record levels for this time of year and the spectre of higher prices looms as the peak summer demand season approaches. AAA Daily Fuel Gauge said the nationwide price of regular gasoline at the pump was $US3.62 a gallon overnight, up 6.8 per cent from a month ago. Current futures prices suggest retail prices nearing $US3.80 a gallon soon. The driving force behind higher gasoline is the price of crude. Nymex crude on a monthly average basis was up 15 per cent in March compared with December, while Brent was up 24 per cent. May-delivery reformulated gasoline blendstock futures settled higher by US2.25 cents at $US3.1302 a gallon, the highest price since July 30, 2008.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Ireland wants to hit bank creditors, ECB says no DUBLIN (AP) - Ireland still wants to force foreign bondholders to bear losses in debt-crippled banks but is being blocked by the European Central Bank, which has the lenders on life support, Finance Minister Michael Noonan said Friday. Ireland's bank-bailout bill officially surged Thursday by 24 billion euros to 70.5 billion euros($100 billion) as part of a new round of ECB-ordered stress tests. Ireland then unveiled plans to slash its largely nationalized banking sector down to just two: Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's the next day said the tests' assumptions were robust, that the worst was over, and the economy is now set to recover gradually. Although it downgraded Ireland's credit rating by one notch, citing increased risks for bondholders under new EU rules to come into effect in 2013, it expects the country to recover faster than Greece or Portugal - Europe's other two worst debt offenders. It added it didn't expect any more downgrades soon, though S&P rival Fitch warned soon after that it may cut its own BBB+ rating on Ireland soon as it assesses the stress tests and other developments since its last downgrade in December. In stock markets, traders reacted to the stress tests by chasing higher the shares of the two bank survivors, while shares of Ireland's only other publicly listed bank, Irish Life & Permanent, plunged to a record low on news it will be broken up. But as experts digested the test results, the issue of how far to push losses on the banks' bondholders remained the focus. Noonan said Ireland intends to force at least 5 billion euros($7 billion) in losses on the most junior class of bank bondholders as part of its surging bailout bill. That represents a small concession by the ECB, which had until this week opposed such a move. But Noonan said hopes of forcing billions more in losses on senior bondholders - chiefly British, German and American banks - were again vetoed by a majority of ECB governors during negotiations that ran right up to Thursday's announcements. Noonan said Ireland would not act unilaterally against the orders of the ECB, which along with the European Commission has been against forcing losses on bondholders since Ireland's banking crisis erupted in 2008. European financial chiefs made protection of senior bondholders a condition of its November bailout agreement with Ireland's previous government, which was ousted from office three weeks ago amid voter fury over the terms of the deal. Noonan expressed frustration with Europe's plans to introduce \"\"burden-sharing\"\" - forcing the creditors of failing banks to cover some debt-restructuring costs - under new rules after 2013, too late for Ireland. He contrasted that with U.S. policies that hit bondholders early in its own banking crisis. \"\"The American way of doing things is to have burden sharing and to make creditors share in the pain. The European way is different,\"\" Noonan said. Noonan said a minority of governors at the Frankfurt-based ECB, notably Germany's Axel Weber, agree with the Irish and American position, and he still hoped it would prevail in the medium term. But he said Ireland had to give up its hopes of greater burden-sharing for now because the ECB is the key source of short-term funds for all of Ireland's banks, none of which is able to borrow on open markets. \"\"The bank in Frankfurt is supplying almost 200 billion euros($280 billion) of liquidity to the Irish banking system. We said we wanted burden-sharing but we would not do it unilaterally. We would only do it with the agreement of Frankfurt and we didn't get the agreement,\"\" Noonan told Irish state broadcasters RTE. He said if Ireland burned any bondholders against ECB instructions, it would risk a loan cut-off and financial chaos. He said, instead, Ireland received \"\"the best we could hope for\"\" when the ECB pledged Thursday night to keep loaning Ireland's banks money regardless of whether their credit ratings are slashed further. \"\"Did we risk the liquidity flow of 200 billion (euros) being cut off, particularly when we expect a downgrade of Irish bank paper?\"\" he said. The ECB has already permitted Ireland to impose heavy haircuts on the junior bondholders at Ireland's most disastrously managed bank, Anglo Irish. It was the first to be nationalized in 2009, has cost the state more than 25 billion euros($35 billion), and is being dismantled. In October, Anglo offered its creditors holding 3.5 billion euros in subordinated bonds a deal that they could be repaid a fraction of their investment, between 5 percent and 20 percent - or refuse the offer and forfeit even more. The Central Bank of Ireland last month said Ireland's six banks still have nearly 7 billion euros in outstanding subordinated bonds, which is debt that gets repaid in the event of bankruptcy only after senior bondholders get their money back. Those bondholders are next in line for brutal haircuts, according to Noonan. But ECB policy means Ireland cannot impose cuts on 16.4 billion euros in senior bonds that are unsecured and outside the scope of Ireland's bank insurance. Nor can the Irish prune any of the 19 billion euros in secured but unguaranteed bank bonds. Secured bonds are debt backed by collateral that can be handed over in case the debt goes unpaid. Noonan said Ireland reserves the right to push the ECB for approval to discount all remaining bonds at Anglo and Irish Nationwide, should any major bondholders there seek to cash in their positions early. Like Anglo, Irish Nationwide has already been fully nationalized, forced to transfer its deposit base to surviving banks, and is being wound down. The Educational Building Society is also fully state-owned and will be merged into Allied Irish. In midafternoon trade on the Irish Stock Exchange, Bank of Ireland was 40 percent higher at 0.31 euros($0.44), Allied Irish 16 percent higher at 0.22 euros($0.31).

Payrolls rose by 216,000 workers last month after a 194,000 gain the prior month, the Labor Department said yesterday in Washington. Economists projected a March increase of 190,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. A separate report showed manufacturing expanded at close to the fastest pace in seven years. “It does look like things have turned the corner,” Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg, said in an interview with Lisa Murphy on Bloomberg Television’s “Fast Forward.” “We’re finally seeing small- and medium-sized companies hiring.” Stocks climbed as the figures showed the world’s largest economy is weathering the highest energy prices in more than two years. Treasuries pared losses after William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the jobs data shouldn’t change the central bank’s plans to buy $600 billion of government securities through June. “I don’t see any reason to pull back from that yet,” Dudley said in response to reporters’ questions about the Fed’s bond-buying program after a speech in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In his speech, he said the recovery is “still tenuous” and “far from the mark” of the central bank’s goals of full employment. Shares Climb The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.5 percent to 1,332.41 at the 4 p.m. close in New York yesterday. Treasuries rose, with the yield on the 10-year note falling to 3.44 percent from 3.47 percent the previous day. Manufacturing expanded in March at about the same pace as February, the strongest month since May 2004. The Tempe, Arizona-based Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index was 61.2 compared with 61.4 in February. Readings greater than 50 signal expansion. While companies stepped up hiring, earnings and hours stagnated, the Labor Department’s figures showed. Average hourly earnings for production workers rose 0.8 percent over the past six months, the smallest gain for such a period since 2004. “With the increased pace of hiring, this suggests that increasing numbers of returning jobless workers may be settling for lower wages than they had earned before the recession,” David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York, said in a note to clients. Fed’s Effectiveness Bill Gross, manager of the world’s biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said the gain in employment suggests the Fed’s bond purchases have been effective. “Their objective obviously is to improve the economy and to create jobs but also to put a floor under the stock market, and we know that’s working,” Gross said yesterday in a radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene. The Fed, after its latest policy meeting March 15, pledged to continue its bond-purchase program in order to “promote a stronger pace of economic recovery.” Policy makers said the economy is on a “firmer footing” while acknowledging a rise in commodity prices. Record exports and gains in business and consumer spending are prompting companies like Chrysler Group LLC and Kohl’s Corp. to boost staff. Other manufacturing reports yesterday showed China’s factories accelerated for the first time in four months, while India’s grew for a 24th month. Chrysler, aiming for its first net profit since emerging from bankruptcy in 2009, plans to hire 1,000 engineers and high- tech workers for its small and midsized vehicles. The Auburn Hills, Michigan-based company is also urging its dealers to hire more salesmen and service workers to help boost sales by 32 percent this year. Adding Staff “Hiring additional personnel in preparation for the spring market is essential for success in 2011,” Peter Grady, vice president of Chrysler’s network development and fleet, said in a memo to dealers last month. Private hiring, which excludes government agencies, rose by 230,000 in March after a 240,000 increase in February, the biggest back-to-back gain since 2006. The separate survey of households showed the size of the labor force increased by 160,000 in March and employment grew by 291,000. That pushed the share of the population that is employed up to 58.5 percent from 58.4 percent a month earlier. Government payrolls decreased for a fifth straight month in March, reflecting cuts at the local level. Factory payrolls increased by 17,000 last month, while the construction industry shed jobs. Led by Services Employment at service-providers rose 185,000 in March, the most since May 2010. Temporary-help services companies added 28,800 workers and retail employment increased by 17,700. Economic growth accelerated to a 3.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 as consumer spending climbed by the most in four years. Oil prices that closed at $107.94 yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since September 2008, may keep climbing should Middle East political turmoil continue unabated, raising the risk that consumer spending will slow. U.S. companies are still trying to gauge the effects of the March 11 earthquake in Japan and the subsequent nuclear crisis on international supply chains. Toyota Motor Corp. expects assembly interruptions that may affect North America plants. - With assistance from Tom Keene and Lisa Murphy in New York and Alex Kowalski in Washington.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Dividends are back in vogue on Wall Street NEW YORK • Big companies increased their dividends by a record amount in the first quarter. Since the start of the year, 117 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index said they would raise or start paying dividends. The value of the new and raised annual dividends announced by these companies amounted to a record $16.6 billion, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. Just 78 companies raised their dividends in the same period a year ago. The surge in dividends reflects a turning point in the long recovery from the financial meltdown in 2008. After the meltdown many companies slashed or eliminated their dividends and, like many Americans, put their cash in the bank and sat on it. As a result, U.S. companies have amassed a record $940 billion in cash. But now the economy is recovering, profits are rising and investors are demanding something for their patience. An easy way to keep shareholders happy is to restore or raise dividends. Even companies that have long resisted dividends are instituting them. Cisco Systems Inc. said it would begin paying shareholders $1.3 billion per year, a record amount for a first-time dividend payer in the S&P 500. \"\"The fact that dividends are increasing is a clear signal that the economy and businesses worldwide are on a much firmer footing than a few years ago,\"\" said Kent Croft, the manager of the $421 million Croft Value Fund. Financial companies announced they would raise annual dividends by $7 billion, accounting for 42 percent of all S&P 500 dividend increases. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is quintupling its annual dividend to $1 a share from 20 cents, amounting to an increase of $3.1 billion. The value of the payout is a record for an S&P 500 company. The increased dividends came after the Federal Reserve announced March 18 it would allow some banks to raise dividends if they passed certain \"\"stress tests.\"\" JPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Co. and State Street were among those that increased their dividends for the first time since the financial crisis. Citigroup Inc. reinstated its dividend. Ten S&P 500 companies announced in the first quarter that they would begin paying dividends. That's the most for any three-month period since at least 2003, when Silverblatt began collecting data. Besides Cisco, discount department store Kohl's and health benefits company WellPoint also became first-time dividend payers. Besides financials, industrial companies and businesses focused on consumer products announced the most dividend increases during the quarter. Among those raising their dividends: cruise operator Carnival Corp., retailer Limited Brands and manufacturer Eaton Corp. But even the strong recovery in dividends hasn't made up for all the losses. With the increases, quarterly dividends by companies in the S&P 500 are 13 percent lower than their peak in 2008. Some companies that have raised their dividends still pay far less than before the recession. That is particularly true for banks and other financial services companies. Their dividend yield, which measures how much cash is being paid per share, runs about 1.41 percent today, far below the 3.32 percent yield in 2007. \"\"Companies are paying more dividends, but they are also taking it slow,\"\" Silverblatt says. \"\"Dividends are far from being completely back.\"\" ' \n",

The deal creates an industry giant that employs 47,500 and serves 15 million phone and 5 million broadband subscribers in 37 states. It comes just more than a decade after the Joe Nacchio-led Qwest, then a fast-growing Internet network operator, acquired U S West and its 14-state local phone business for $45 billion. \"\"It was the end of an era when Qwest took over from U S West because Qwest was not a real telephone company. They were sort of a young, long-distance company,\"\" said telecommunications historian Herbert Hackenburg. \"\"This goes in the opposite direction. This merger brings them back to a telephone company that has a pretty good record.\"\" Incorporated in 1968, Monroe, La.-based CenturyLink is a rural phone operator at its core. The company, formerly CenturyTel, exploded in size and ventured into urban markets with the purchase of Kansas-based Embarq in July 2009. Announced a year ago, the Qwest merger turns CenturyLink into the nation's No. 3 local phone company, behind AT&T and Verizon. CenturyLink paid about $12 billion in stock and assumed nearly $12 billion in Qwest debt. CenturyLink stock dropped 1 percent Friday to close at $41.03. Qwest stock ceased trading Thursday. Consumer bills and Qwest signs will switch to the CenturyLink brand over the next several months. Monroe will serve as the corporate headquarters. CenturyLink's acquisition binge comes as the nation's landline phone business is eroding. Millions of consumers dump wireline phone service annually, relying solely on cellphones or switching to Internet-based voice offerings from cable-TV companies. CenturyLink is banking that broadband and television service provided over an Internet network will help the company stem landline losses and even grow revenue. It also says synergies from the merger will save $625 million in annual operating and investment costs. The company is done purchasing phone lines for now, said chief executive Glen Post. \"\"We don't feel like we need to go out and look for additional wireline acquisitions at this point,\"\" Post said recently. \"\"We would like to expand in areas where we see ready growth potential in the months ahead.\"\" Four Qwest board members — CEO Ed Mueller, Charles Biggs, Michael Roberts and James Unruh — will join the Century Link board. Denver will serve as one of CenturyLink's six regional headquarters and will be home to the company's enterprise-business division. The combined company employs about 7,500 in the state. But Qwest's corporate functions, such as accounting and human resources, are expected to face the brunt of merger-related job cuts. Layoff notifications have already started in Denver. \"\"Personnel decisions will continue to be made in a cascading process,\"\" a spokeswoman said Friday. Qwest's Colorado roots span more than a century. The state's first telephone exchange opened in 1879. U S West was spawned from the antitrust breakup of the old AT&T monopoly, or Ma Bell, in 1984. When Qwest acquired U S West in June 2000, the company quickly moved to switch out the high-profile U S West signs atop its 52-story headquarters building in downtown Denver with the Qwest name. Those signs will be taken down, with the naming rights expiring in June 2012 and Qwest's workforce in the building dwindling by more than half over the past year. Qwest and its predecessor companies have occupied the skyscraper at 1801 California St. since 1982. \"\"It's an astounding loss for Denver. Back in the Mountain Bell days, when Mountain Bell was a part of AT&T, every single major division of AT&T was located in Denver,\"\" said Hackenburg, founder of the Denver-based Telecommunications History Group. \"\"Slowly, all of those different things have disappeared.\"\" Andy Vuong: 303-954-1209, avuong@denverpost.com or twitter.com/andyvuong Linking up with naming rights CenturyLink assumes these naming-rights deals from Qwest: • Qwest headquarters at 1801 California St. in Denver — naming rights included in lease agreement, which expires in June 2012. • Qwest Field (Seattle Seahawks' stadium) — reportedly $75 million for 15 years (10 years with five-year renewal option), signed in 2004. • Qwest Center Omaha (convention center in Omaha) — reportedly $14 million for 15 years, signed in 2003. • Qwest Arena (hockey, basketball, multipurpose arena in Boise, Idaho) — reportedly multiple years remaining, although terms are unavailable.

The Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate dropped to 8.8 percent last month, the lowest in two years and down from 8.9 percent the month before. That came as employers added 216,000 net jobs, higher than the revised 194,000 gain in February and above the 190,000 in new jobs that analysts had expected. The report hardly showed gangbuster job creation, but it confirms an ongoing economic expansion and the fact that employers are adding jobs at a pace that is likely to chip away at the nation's yawning unemployment problem over time. The steady-as-she-goes report helps assuage fears that turmoil in the Middle East, higher fuel prices or other factors are steering the U.S. recovery off course, despite some uneven economic data recently. Financial markets reacted positively to the news: the Dow Jones industrial average rose 56.99 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 12,376.72. The Standard & Poor's 500 index added 6.58 points to close at 1,332.41. Following the fourth consecutive month of declines, the unemployment rate is a full percentage point lower than it was in November. And the three-month average pace of private-sector job growth reached its highest level since 2006. \"\"The recovery in employment is here to stay,\"\" said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at California State University. A separate report Friday showed continued strong growth in the manufacturing sector, with the Institute for Supply Management's index of activity at the nation's factories edging down to 61.2 from 61.4. Numbers above 50 indicate expansion. In the details of the Labor Department report, there was not much to love but plenty to like. The improvement in the unemployment rate was attributed to the 291,000 additional workers who described themselves as having a job, rather than people giving up their job searches out of frustration. A broader measure of unemployment — which also captures discouraged people who have given up looking for work and those who are working part time but want a full-time job — fell to 15.7 percent, from 15.9 percent. The length of the average workweek rose to 33.6 hours, from 33.5, allowing those who already were working to take home more income (though in a less promising sign, average hourly earnings dropped).

Shanghai-based Shenyin Wanguo Securities predicts the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a major gauge of inflation, to increase 5.3 percent in March, the highest in nearly two years, driven by rising food prices and a lower year-on-year comparison basis. Food prices are likely to jump 12.3 percent from a year ago while the lower comparison basis would contribute 3.4 percent to the CPI rise, the company said in a report. The Bank of Communications also expects March CPI to rise more than 5 percent on pressure from imported inflation. Lu Zhengwei, chief economist with Industrial Bank, said the central bank is likely to hike interest rates after mid-April. China will release economic data for March in mid-April. February's CPI remained on par with that of January at 4.9 percent. The growth rose from 4.6 percent in December but was less than the 28-month high of 5.1 percent in November. ' \n",

Sales of new vehicles including minivehicles in Japan totaled 437,599 units in March, down 35.1 percent from a year earlier and marking the sharpest percentage point fall on record for the month due to the disaster that devastated northeastern and eastern Japan, industry bodies said. The percentage decline, the biggest since auto sales data began to be compiled in 1968, beat the previous record fall of 33.3 percent in March 1974, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association and the Japan Mini Vehicles Association. Japan's worst-ever disaster forced automakers to temporarily suspend production and discouraged consumers from shopping even in areas that were not affected by it. Isetan Co., a major department store under the wing of Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd., said sales in March plunged 23.5 percent from a year earlier. Mitsukoshi Ltd., which also belongs to the holding company, reported a year-on-year drop of 22.8 percent in sales for the month. Takashimaya Co. suffered a sales decline of 16.8 percent, while J. Front Retailing Co., which has Daimaru and Matsuzakaya department stores under its umbrella, incurred a drop of 9.6 percent. The automobile dealers association said pre-quake inventories were running out and sales in April may therefore be lower than March. The industry body expressed hope for carmakers to resume full-scale production promptly. In March, sales of new cars, other than minivehicles with engine displacements of up to 660 cc, plunged 37.0 percent to 279,389 units for the all-time sharpest percentage point decline and the seventh straight month of fall. Sales fell short of 300,000 units for the first time in 37 years. Sales of minivehicles dived 31.6 percent to 158,210 units for the second sharpest percentage point fall and the sixth straight month of decline.

More hiring cut the unemployment rate to 8.8% as employers added 216,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said. Factories, retailers, the education and health care sectors, and professional and financial services all expanded their payrolls. Those gains offset layoffs by local governments, construction and telecommunications. The private sector added more than 200,000 jobs for a second straight month, the first time that's happened since 2006 - more than a year before the recession started. \"\"It's certainly indicative of continuing improvement in the labor market, with two months in a row of really solid private payrolls,\"\" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities. \"\"It's not a blowout number, but all in all, it's a good report.\"\" The improved outlook propelled the Dow to a 2011 high in early trading. Stocks then pared their gains as oil prices climbed to 30-month highs. The Dow closed up 57 points, or 0.46%, to 12,376.72. The new figures could mark a turning point in job creation. America's largest companies plan to step up hiring in the next six months, a March survey of CEOs found. Google, Siemens and Ford, among others, have said they plan to add workers. Economists expect the stronger hiring to endure throughout the year, producing a net gain of about 2.5 million jobs for 2011. Even so, that would make up for only a small portion of the 7.5 million jobs wiped out during the recession. The economy must average up to 300,000 new jobs a month to significantly lower unemployment. The unemployment rate has fallen a full percentage point since November, the sharpest four-month drop since 1983. Stepped-up hiring is the main reason. Still, the job gains haven't led many people who stopped looking for work during the recession to start again. The number of people who are either working or seeking a job remains surprisingly low for this stage of the recovery. Fewer than two-thirds of American adults are either working or looking for work - the lowest participation rate in 25 years. Just 64.2% of adults have a job or are looking for one - the lowest participation rate since 1984. The number has been shrinking for four years. It suggests many people remain discouraged about their job prospects even as hiring is picking up. People without jobs who aren't looking for one aren't counted as unemployed. Once they start looking again, they're classified as unemployed, and the unemployment rate can go back up. That can happen even if the economy is adding jobs. \"\"It is always possible that as the job market improves, people will start looking again and the unemployment rate could go up,\"\" said economist Bill Cheney of John Hancock Financial Services. \"\"But the normal pattern is once it starts coming down as rapidly as it has over the last few months, it keeps on going down.\"\" ' \n",

Kuncheria NEW DELHI, April 2 (Reuters) - Indian police on Saturday charged a former minister, the Reliance ADA Group and the Indian joint venture partners of Telenor and Etisalat , in a multi-billion dollar telecoms licencing corruption scandal that has rocked the government and business establishments. Andimuthu Raja, the telecoms minister at the time of a flawed 2008 mobile phone licence allocation process, Managing Director of Unitech Sanjay Chandra, and three officials of Reliance ADA Group were also charged in the case, a government lawyer told reporters. \"\"The charges are conspiracy, cheating, forgery of documents, abuse of official position and abetment,\"\" A.K. Singh, special public prosecutor told reporters after the charges were filed in court. The graft scandal, potentially India's largest ever, has damaged confidence in the Congress-led coalition government, led to calls for the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and worried investors in Asia's third-largest economy. (For a Q+A on the scandal, see [ID:nL3E7F11Z5]) It is one of the several corruption scandals that have emerged during Singh's second term, hobbling policymaking and diverting the government's attention away from pushing forward crucial economic reforms. Some of India's leading businesses have been questioned and past official decisions scrutinised or reversed. These events have weighed on stocks, with the Mumbai market ending the March quarter as the world's worst performer. India may have lost as much as $39 billion due to violations of rules when lucrative mobile phone licences and radio spectrum were granted in 2008, the state auditor estimated, a sum equivalent to the country's defence budget. Raja was forced to resign and later arrested over the auditor's report. He has been accused in court earlier of taking bribes from two firms which are now part of the India operations of Etisalat and Telenor. Singh said the police would file the bribery charges later. Others arrested include Shahid Balwa, the vice chairman of Etisalat's Indian venture. Police have also questioned Anil Ambani, the billionaire chairman of Reliance ADA Group and Prashant Ruia, the chief executive of steel-to-telecoms conglomerate Essar group. A parliamentary panel probing the scandal has summoned iconic business tycoon Ratan Tata and Anil Ambani for questioning next week. All of the accused have denied any wrongdoing. The telecoms ministry is considering whether to cancel several licences, after the auditor's report accused these firms of not being eligible for them, sparking off worries about regulatory stability. The Supreme Court, under its tough new chief justice, has been monitoring the progress of the case after having reprimanded Singh for not moving quick enough to act against his minister. Faced with a resurgent opposition, Singh's government has not been able to undertake economic reforms such as freeing up diesel prices and allowing foreign investors into the supermarket sector. The corruption scandals, which include charges of graft at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and of officials at state-run banks taking bribes for corporate loans, have tarnished Singh's image as a clean and effective leader. They could also affect the performance of the ruling Congress party in five state elections that begin in mid-April, in which the Congress must perform well or risk the coalition unravelling.

The solid job gains and slight reduction in the unemployment rate surprised some economists who have worried that the unfolding disaster in Japan and unrest in the oil-producing Middle East could slow the recovery. “Gas and food costs are squeezing people’s spending power, and, no question, that’s hurting,” said IHS Global Insight’s chief US economist, Nigel Gault. “But the employment data suggest that the labor market actually had some good momentum and we’re in a better place to withstand those shocks than we thought.” The national unemployment rate slipped to 8.8 percent last month, from 8.9 percent in February, and is now at the lowest level since March 2008. The economy added 216,000 jobs last month, its sixth straight month of gains. Private  employers drove the growth, accounting for more than 200,000 of the new jobs — the biggest gain in private sector employment since 2006. Government employment fell by 14,000 jobs. Industries vital to the Massachusetts economy, such as health care and technology services, posted strong national job gains last month. Professional and business services, which includes a variety of technology, scientific, and consulting firms, added 78,000 jobs nationally. The health care industry added 37,000 jobs in March. Leisure and hospitality, which includes hotels and restaurants, also gained 37,000 jobs. Denis McSweeney, regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Boston, said the job growth in these sectors bodes well for Massachusetts and Boston. In the Boston metropolitan area, for example, education and health services, the region’s biggest employment sector, grew 23 percent in 2010, he said. Leisure and hospitality jobs, generally fueled by tourism, increased 2.3 percent in the same period, triple the national growth rate, McSweeney said. “The employment situation for March signals positive vibes for the Commonwealth,” McSweeney said. “Health care, education, leisure and hospitality, those gains are all good news for the state.” The state reports March employment and unemployment on April 14. In February, the state’s unemployment rate was 8.2 percent, well below the national average. The national unemployment rate, however, has fallen steeply in recent months, plunging a percentage point since November. Scott Ragusa, president of contract business at Winter, Wyman Cos., a Waltham staffing firm, said he is seeing signs of the improvement locally. The firm’s client companies had 35 percent more jobs to offer last month than they did in March 2010. Winter, Wyman itself currently has 26 job openings, primarily sales positions. Ragusa said the firm, which works with companies in the financial, technology, and human resources industries, said employers in all three sectors appear poised to hire. “They’re adding in critical areas right now,” Ragusa said of employers. “But I would still say companies are running pretty lean compared to two years ago.” Despite the job gains of recent months, the economy has only begun to recover from the recent recession, considered the worst since the Great Depression. The nation lost nearly 9 million jobs in the downturn, and has so far regained just 1.4 million of those jobs since the labor market began its rebound last year. “It’s a long way back,” McSweeney said. Not all the news in yesterday’s report was good. Despite recent job growth, long-term unemployment increased. About 6 million, or 45 percent, of the nation’s 13.5 million unemployed have been out of work for six months our more. That’s up from 43.9 percent in February. John E. Silvia, chief economist for Wells Fargo & Co. in Charlotte, N.C., said the job gains primarily benefited highly skilled workers, including those who have extensive computer skills. “The people benefiting from this [gain in jobs] are not the same people who lost their jobs three to five years ago,” he said. “And those jobs are not coming back.” Megan Woolhouse can be reached at mwoolhouse@globe.com.

Noonan will press for a cut in the loan rate when EU finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Budapest on April 7-9, the paper said, citing sources at the Department of Finance. The news comes after the Irish Central Bank ruled Thursday that four lenders needed to raise another 24 bn euros ($34 bn) to withstand another crisis, after carrying out vital stress tests as a condition of the bailout. \"\"He (Noonan) will be explaining the results of the stress tests and the actions that the government is going to take,\"\" the Irish Times quoted a source as saying. \"\"Debt sustainability is important. Running down the interest rate can help that.\"\" The Central Bank had also ordered a drastic overhaul of the eurozone nation's stricken banking sector on Thursday, as the total cost of bailing out its lenders was set to top 70 bn euros. Ireland, plagued by banking worries, was rescued last year with a huge 85-bn-euro ($115-bn) bailout package, which included a contribution of 67 bn euros from the European Union and International Monetary Fund. The last Irish government was kicked out by voters earlier this year amid deep-rooted public anger over the humiliating deal. The new administration, headed by Prime Minister Enda Kenny, wants partners to lower the average 5.8-percent interest it must pay for international financial assistance. However, eurozone leaders have so far refused to give Dublin the same leeway as Greece, which saw a one-percentage-point interest rate cut and its repayment period extended last month. Kenny has vowed to resist EU pressure to raise Ireland's cherished 12.5-percent corporation tax rate, in return for easier terms on the rescue package. The rate is considerably lower than other European countries, sparking accusations from EU leaders that it gives Ireland an unfair advantage and makes Dublin's problems worse because the government loses revenue. Meanwhile, staff from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund will arrive in Dublin on Tuesday to review the bailout programme. ' \n",

However, rising food and fuel prices remain threats to a strong economic revival, analysts warned. Employers added a robust 216,000 jobs in March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, as the unemployment rate ticked down one-tenth of a percentage point to 8.8percent. Private-sector employment rose by 230,000, but a net loss of 14,000 government jobs nationwide dragged down the broader number. The figures add up to an economy firing on almost all cylinders. \"\"The job market is kicking into full gear. Job growth has accelerated to 200,000 per month, which is sufficient to meaningfully bring down unemployment,\"\" said Mark Zandi, the chief economist forecaster at Moody's Analytics. \"\"It is also encouraging the job growth is increasingly broad-based across industries. Only state and local governments are laying off workers.\"\" Manufacturers added 17,000 jobs in March, the fifth straight month that they've boosted employment. The vigorous health-care sector added almost 37,000 jobs, and the category of professional and business services - which includes well-paying white-collar jobs - surged by 78,000. Temporary employment, usually a harbinger of future hiring, also was up by 28,800 jobs. Even if the March numbers are repeated in the months ahead, however, it will take a long time to erase the 8 million job losses suffered during the Great Recession of 2007-09, the worst since the 1930s. But March suggests the recovery is taking root. \"\"The numbers were solid, indicating that business confidence is improving to the point where hiring is beginning to step up,\"\" said Chris Varvares, the president of forecaster Macroeconomic Advisers. \"\"Numbers like this will generate income, increase confidence for consumers and are the kinds of numbers we need to see on an ongoing basis to have the self-sustaining recovery and expansion that is in our forecast.\"\" Ohio's jobless rate was 9.2percent in February, the most-recent figure available, and the central Ohio rate for that month was 8.2 percent. The job increases in yesterday's national report and the projection for more new hiring reflect the trend in central Ohio, as well. Manpower's quarterly employment survey, released early last month, shows that 22 percent of Columbus-area employers interviewed plan to hire during the second quarter. The outlook was the fourth-best among U.S. metropolitan areas. Even though the national report arrived on April Fools' Day, yesterday's numbers were no prank. They followed by a day the close of the first quarter of 2011, when U.S. stocks surged on expectations that the U.S. economy is getting its game back. The benchmark S&P 500 gained 5.4 percent in the first three months of this year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.7percent, its best quarter since 1999, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 4.8percent. One shadow grew darker yesterday, as crude oil traded above $108 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, threatening to slow the recovery. High oil prices bring pain at the gasoline pump, sapping consumer spirits and spending power. \"\"Higher energy and other commodity prices are the most serious threat to optimism regarding the job market and broader economy. Oil prices much above current prices for more than a few weeks will do serious damage,\"\" Zandi warned. Higher gasoline prices are like a tax on consumption. Shoppers might cut back their purchases of other goods if pump prices remain high. The AAA auto club said the nationwide average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline stood at $3.61 yesterday, up from $3.38 a month ago and $2.80 a year ago. ' \n",

He said Nasdaq would keep the NYSE floor - the icon of capitalism that was created in 1792 by brokers and merchants who met under a buttonwood tree in lower Manhattan . Upstart trading venues like BATS have eaten deep into the market share of these traditional venues, forcing them in the last decade to upgrade and embrace electronic trading - and to look to mergers to survive. Nasdaq, the smallest of the four exchanges in play, needed to do something to stay relevant in the years ahead, some said. If it and ICE succeed, the world's largest bourse operators would be headquartered in the United States, Brazil, and Asia - leaving Europe with a bruised Deutsche Boerse. \"\"Nasdaq had a real risk of being marginalized,\"\" said David Weild, founder of Capital Markets Advisory Partners and former vice chairman at Nasdaq, in the corporate client division. Under the proposal, Atlanta-based ICE would purchase NYSE's London-based Liffe platform, seen as a profitable gem, while Nasdaq would acquire its stock exchanges in New York, Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels, and Lisbon, its U.S. options venues and its technology suite. Some details of how a deal would work have not yet been worked out. The management and the board of directors have not yet been determined, Greifeld said, adding he hadn't spoken to Niederauer or other NYSE executives. But a group of banks led by Bank of America and Wells Fargo is prepared to arrange $3.8 billion of financing for the cash portion of the deal, Nasdaq and ICE said. \"\"From a purely nationalist point of view, as an American, a lot of people are going to say yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great,\"\" said Kenneth Polcari, managing director at ICAP Corporates, a NYSE floor broker. \"\"But from a business point of view ... from a true global perspective, the Deutsche Boerse is probably the better option.\"\" NYSE shares closed up 12.6 percent at $39.60, while Deutsche Boerse closed down 1.4 percent in Frankfurt. Nasdaq shares rose strongly through Friday to close at $28.23, up 9.2 percent, while ICE shares slipped 3.1 percent to $119.75. BIDDING WAR? Borse Dubai, Nasdaq's largest shareholder, and Sweden's Investor AB, the second-largest, said they backed the bid. Deutsche Boerse said it \"\"continues to strongly believe that the envisaged merger of Deutsche Boerse AG and NYSE Euronext is the best possible combination for both shareholder groups and the stakeholders of the companies.\"\" NYSE Euronext said its board would \"\"carefully review\"\" the new offer and urged shareholders not to take any action pending its review. A source said there was some \"\"shock\"\" that the cash portion of the counterbid was so small. \"\"If I were at New York and Deutsche Boerse, I'd be thinking we don't have to match the price, we just have to build up the cash component a bit,\"\" said Thomas Caldwell, CEO of Caldwell Securities Ltd, a NYSE shareholder. There is a steep 250 million euro ($356 million) termination fee attached to Deutsche Boerse's friendly deal. Moody's Investors Service said Nasdaq's announcement makes the agency more likely to cut the company's debt ratings to junk over the medium term, while Standard & Poor's said that it might cut the exchange's ratings to junk in the near term. Two junk ratings could create a headache for the combined exchange, because NYSE bondholders would have the right to force the company to buy back their $2.1 billion of debt. Nasdaq could be forced to raise even more money. In Liffe, Sprecher would get an interest-rate business that eluded him when ICE's bid for the Chicago Board of Trade failed four years ago, and a successful deal could put pressure on chief rival CME Group Inc ICE's market cap is $9.2 billion, about in line with NYSE Euronext. For Nasdaq, with a $4.5 billion market cap, the deal would expand its core, albeit low-margin, stock-trading business, and could raise questions for shareholders well aware that the other exchange deals are driven largely by a need to diversify into more profitable derivatives trading. EGOS AND OFFERS Nasdaq was created in 1971 as the world's first electronic stock market by members of National Association of Securities Dealers frustrated by the Big Board's slowness to embrace new technology, and seeking to pressure trading costs. The vast majority of North American and European stock trading is now high-speed and all-electronic, with Nasdaq and NYSE boasting some of the world's best technology. When Deutsche Boerse bid for NYSE, CEO Reto Francioni acknowledged \"\"we have a bumpy road ahead of us.\"\" Some observers say his career hinges on winning NYSE. Intensifying the merger race, regulators want to run much of the private swaps market though transparent venues in the wake of the financial crisis, an opportunity for exchanges. Under the counterbid, NYSE shareholders would receive $14.24 in cash plus 0.4069 of a share of Nasdaq stock. The Deutsche Boerse proposal would exchange each NYSE Euronext share for 0.47 share of the combined company's stock. Nasdaq and ICE said that within 12 to 18 months, the combined franchise would provide \"\"double-digit accretion\"\" to shareholders and save $740 million in annual operating costs. The Deutsche Boerse deal sees $400 million in cost savings and that immediately add to adjusted earnings. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Evercore Partners are advising Nasdaq, while Lazard, Broadhaven Capital Partners, and BMO Capital Markets Corp are advising ICE. ' \n",

The market is clearly overdue for the setback I was looking for last week. Attempts by fund managers to goose their quarterly numbers likely played a role in the rally into the end of the month, while the very good jobs numbers boosted stocks even higher on Friday. One of the more surprising developments last week was the surge in small-cap stocks, as the Russell 2000 moved above the February highs on Thursday. This is very positive if the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite can also surpass their February peaks, as the Dow Industrials did on Friday. The chart of the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) shows the completion of the trading range (lines a and b) with upside targets at $85.50 and then $87: Click to Enlarge The week ahead will be a quiet one in terms of economic reports, with the ISM Non-Manufacturing Index on Tuesday that gives us a reading on the health of the economy, followed by jobless claims Thursday. The EIA’s latest petroleum-inventory report will be released Wednesday, but more important for crude oil will be any new developments in Libya. If Gaddafi were to step down it would dampen the rally in crude oil prices. WHAT TO WATCH S&P 500 The monthly chart of the Spyder Trust (SPY) shows that the next major resistance stands at $141 to $145. The lower monthly close for SPY has caused its momentum, which had been rising since the end of September, to flatten out. Therefore a higher close in April is needed to keep the momentum from turning lower, as it did in May 2010. The NYSE advance/decline line has surpassed its February highs, which is positive for stocks in general. There is initial support for SPY at $131.50 and then at $130.40. The $128.30 level should hold on a deeper pullback. Dow Industrials The Diamonds Trust (DIA) surpassed the February highs Friday at $123.64, and has next resistance at $124.80 and then $128.50 to $129. Strong action last week leaves first support at $122.50 to $121.60, with much stronger levels in the $120.50 area. Sector Focus It was a tough quarter for stock pickers unless you were in the energy sector. As I noted in Friday’s article, only the Energy Select Spyder (XLE) and the Industrial Select Spyder (XLI) were able to outperform the S&P 500 in the first quarter. This is quite unusual, as more often there are three or four sectors that outperform the S&P 500. Typically stocks are not as strong in the second quarter, leading to the well-worn phrase “sell in May and go away.” More Sector Focus ' \n",

Into this neighbourhood, one of the world's hottest social media companies has promised to stride, offering urban rebirth in exchange for a tax break. Taxe incentives to bring businesses to blighted streets are not unusual. But this is San Francisco. And Twitter. The mayor supports the plan, but progressive politicians — and now the city's largest public employee union — call the proposal a poorly crafted giveaway to the rich. The conflict comes at a time when the city's high tech economy teems with energy not seen since before the first Internet bubble burst more than a decade ago. At issue is the city's payroll tax. San Francisco is the only city in California to levy its business tax based on how much companies pay workers, rather than how much money they take in. Since Twitter emerged as a side project of a San Francisco podcasting company in 2006, the business has grown from a handful of employees to a few hundred. With investors pouring money into Twitter, the company expects to grow to more than 3,000. To do that, Twitter needs a lot more space. One option would be to flee to a sprawling suburban campus in Silicon Valley, where adding more employees would not mean adding to the tax bill. But earlier this month, recently appointed Mayor Ed Lee announced what seemed like a winning solution for everyone. Twitter had signed a letter of intent to sign a six-year lease on several hundred thousand square feet of office space in a historic building in the struggling Mid-Market neighbourhood. The only condition: The city must agree to exempt Twitter from paying any new payroll taxes on any additional hires. For a company that expects to add thousands of new of employees in the next few years, the savings would add up quickly. \"\"This is the moment we have been waiting for,\"\" Lee said of the proposed deal. \"\"The transformative nature of an anchor tenant like Twitter will revitalize this community.\"\" Yet in San Francisco, where an overall economy largely untouched by the recession has kept real estate prices among the highest in the country, some low-income residents worry that revitalization will just lead to higher rents. And city employees facing layoffs and contract concessions thanks to a massive budget shortfall resent what they see as a giveaway to venture capitalists and a bailout for landlords. \"\"Who are the (Twitter) investors?\"\" Supervisor John Avalos told The San Francisco Examiner. \"\"Probably some of the wealthiest people in this country. And we are giving them more wealth.\"\" Last Tuesday, members of a neighbourhood group protested outside Twitter's current headquarters, about a mile from the proposed new offices. They accused Twitter of not living up to its pledge to be a good neighbour. They complained neither the city nor the company have considered the low-income residents who would be adversely impacted by rising rents spurred by the prosperity Twitter could bring. \"\"The residents are feeling that if they're not going to benefit from this revitalization that the city is pushing for, it really doesn't make sense for these companies to stay in San Francisco,\"\" said Angelica Cabande, director of South of Market Community Action Network. Twitter declined to comment on the tax-break fracas. As a result of the controversy, a lawmaker on the Board of Supervisors' progressive wing, Ross Mirkarimi, has proposed an alternative measure he says will fix an underlying legal flaw that has led to anxiety among hot tech companies looking to grow. San Francisco's payroll tax is unusual enough, but one provision makes it even more unique. The city in 2004 added language to the tax code to make clear that tax collectors considered stock options a part of employees' compensation and hence taxable as part of the payroll. For tech startups, stock options are one of the most common ways to hold onto employees, especially when a lack of funds doesn't allow them to offer competitive salaries. When lucky companies reach a point where they can make their initial public offering of stock, those options can turn into a major windfall for workers. But for companies in San Francisco, that windfall sticks employers with a huge tax increase right at the time they've issued the stock in an effort to expand. Mirkarimi's proposal would place a two-year moratorium on taxing any company's stock options to ease the fears not just of Twitter, but other San Francisco-based startups like social gaming leader Zynga and consumer review website Yelp. \"\"You don't want to write law in a way that only helps one company or one neighbourhood in one part of the city,\"\" Mirkarimi said. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the Twitter package, and Mirkarimi predicts it will pass even without his vote. If that happens, Service Employees International Union Local 1021, the public employees union, may seek a ballot measure that could delay the deal until voters weigh in. City economic officials paint any failure of the deal not as a loss to Twitter but as a loss for the neighbourhood, where more than half of the available commercial real estate sits vacant. While Twitter is the big fish the city is seeking to catch, any businesses within the geographic zone defined by the legislation would get a similar tax break. \"\"The benefit we want, which is jobs in this area, is not happening without some incentive,\"\" said Jennifer Matz, director of the city's Office of Economic and Workforce Development. Without such incentives, she said, the neighbourhood has not seen improvement for a generation. \"\"It resisted the last dot-com boom.\"\" ' \n",

No formal ceremonies are planned. There will be no speeches. The absence of pomp underscores Page's intense focus on the job ahead - spurring Google to innovate faster as it battles Facebook and other competitors, to react more like a nimble startup even as it zooms past 25,000 employees. As he takes the reins, Page's aim appears to be to hone Google's sense of discipline, to keep the company's management structure as flat as possible despite its growth, and particularly to urge Googlers to continue to think big. But there are also questions about whether Page's personality, including his detachment and his past unwillingness to be the public face of Google, will well serve a company facing a host of regulatory challenges. \"\"To a large extent, the culture of Google is what Larry wants it to be,\"\" said Craig Silverstein, who joined Page and co-founder Sergey Brin as the startup's first employee in 1998. Google announced in January that Page, Google's CEO from its incorporation in 1998 until Eric Schmidt's arrival in 2001, would again become CEO this month. Since then, Page has made some subtle but interesting changes to how the company operates. He has told Googlers to change how they run meetings to make them more focused and productive, and he has directed executives to meet in public areas of the Googleplex so they will be more accessible to hearing ideas from rank-and-file Googlers, people familiar with the changes say. \"\"Face of the company\"\" Schmidt and Brin have been more in the public spotlight in the past decade than the 38-year-old son of a computer science professor from Michigan. But Page has remained a driving force within Google since 2001, insisting on reviewing every hire, people familiar with the company say, and continuing to push hyperambitious projects like the company's effort to scan every book ever published into a vast digital library. \"\"It's certainly true that Eric is the public face, but inside Google, the founders are still very much the face of the company,\"\" said Silverstein, who spoke just after the Jan. 20 announcement of Page's new role. Google declined to make Page available for an interview. Paul Buchheit, the former Googler who coined the phrase, \"\"Don't Be Evil,\"\" said Page's return sends a signal to Silicon Valley that innovation and taking risks for big ideas still matter at Google. \"\"This notion that something being impossible doesn't really bother you, that's really central to a lot of Google's big projects,\"\" said Buchheit, who created Gmail before leaving the company in 2006. \"\"It's taking on things that might be possible or might be impossible, but if they are possible, it would have a really big impact on the world.\"\" Page has a foresight that few people have, Silverstein added. Page was a driving force for the massive computing power Google needed to create, long before many at Google saw the need for products like Google Instant - the feature the search giant introduced last year, and that Yahoo (YHOO) recently imitated, that begins to offer search results as soon as users type a letter into the query box. \"\"He'll have an idea that seems really crazy,\"\" Silverstein said, \"\"and there will be all this push-back, and he'll have none of it.\"\" Outside-the-box CEO No one expects Page to be a standard-issue CEO. Those like Silverstein who know Page well say that while he isn't shy, neither is he an extroverted, hail fellow well met. But he has also been described as brusque with people whose ideas he doesn't value, and he has often shunned press attention. Some Google watchers say Page's famous reticence and aversion to publicity may not serve him well as CEO. \"\"Brilliant engineers like Page are really good at things they can measure. They have a high IQ, but often a low EQ,\"\" or emotional quotient, Ken Auletta, who spent extensive time inside the Googleplex reporting his book, \"\"Googled: The End of the World as We Know It,\"\" said in an email. In addition, Page faces a full and complex plate of legal and regulatory issues when he takes on his new job. Just this week, the Federal Trade Commission forced Google into a 20-year commitment to accept outside supervision on privacy, and archrival Microsoft filed an antitrust complaint against Google in Europe. \"\"Larry is not as talented at things he can't measure, like why governments and citizens might fear Google's dominance, or issues like privacy and copyright. Page certainly is more aware of government and other outside concerns. But they make him impatient. Which is dangerous when you're wrestling with an 800-pound government gorilla.\"\" Doubts cloud future Veteran tech analyst Rob Enderle, who praised the reshuffling in January, said he has become concerned since then that Page \"\"will not step up to the full requirements of the job, which include being the human face of Google.\"\" Yardsticks like profit and revenue suggest Google has never been more successful, and its Android smartphone software gives the company a powerful foothold in the emerging mobile Web. But Google stock is down nearly 6 percent since the Jan. 20 announcement that Page would replace Schmidt as CEO, a period in which the Nasdaq is up 3 percent. Buchheit always believed Page's return as CEO was inevitable, and that Page's determination to swing for the fences is critical to Google's identity. \"\"It was just a question of when it was going to happen,\"\" Buchheit said of Page's return. \"\"He was originally the CEO, and the only reason that changed was because the VCs required it to change. He has a lot of pretty strong opinions about how this thing should be run, and he's stayed very involved in the company.\"\" ' \n",

The subcommittee learned that Morgan Stanley lost money on the collateralized debt obligation that Goldman had a hand in arranging and marketing, the Journal said. The dispute between the rival investment banks got so heated that Morgan Stanley considered suing Goldman over its losses, it said. The Senate's investigations subcommittee normally follows up its hearings with reports that outline the findings and recommend legislative reforms. An aide to Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat who heads the subcommittee, declined to comment on the report. Late last year, two people familiar with the subcommittee told Reuters that they expected the report to be finished in early 2011 and said it would contain more information than surfaced during last year's series of subcommittee hearings. An all-day hearing last spring on the role Goldman played in creating and marketing several CDOs - complex securities constructed from a pool of subprime mortgaged-backed bonds - drew particular attention. A number of current and former Goldman executives testified at the hearing, including Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein. (Editing by Vicki Allen) ' \n",

Into this neighborhood, one of the world's hottest social media companies has promised to stride, offering urban rebirth in exchange for a tax break. Tax incentives to bring businesses to blighted streets are not unusual. But this is San Francisco. And Twitter. The mayor supports the plan, but progressive politicians - and now the city's largest public employee union - call the proposal a poorly crafted giveaway to the rich. The conflict comes at a time when the city's high tech economy teems with energy not seen since before the first Internet bubble burst more than a decade ago. At issue is the city's payroll tax. San Francisco is the only city in California to levy its business tax based on how much companies pay workers, rather than how much money they take in. Since Twitter emerged as a side project of a San Francisco podcasting company in 2006, the business has grown from a handful of employees to a few hundred. With investors pouring money into Twitter, the company expects to grow to more than 3,000. To do that, Twitter needs a lot more space. One option would be to flee to a sprawling suburban campus in Silicon Valley, where adding more employees would not mean adding to the tax bill. But earlier this month, recently appointed Mayor Ed Lee announced what seemed like a winning solution for everyone. Twitter had signed a letter of intent to sign a six-year lease on several hundred thousand square feet of office space in a historic building in the struggling Mid-Market neighborhood. The only condition: The city must agree to exempt Twitter from paying any new payroll taxes on any additional hires. For a company that expects to add thousands of new of employees in the next few years, the savings would add up quickly. \"\"This is the moment we have been waiting for,\"\" Lee said of the proposed deal. \"\"The transformative nature of an anchor tenant like Twitter will revitalize this community.\"\" Yet in San Francisco, where an overall economy largely untouched by the recession has kept real estate prices among the highest in the country, some low-income residents worry that revitalization will just lead to higher rents. And city employees facing layoffs and contract concessions thanks to a massive budget shortfall resent what they see as a giveaway to venture capitalists and a bailout for landlords. \"\"Who are the (Twitter) investors?\"\" Supervisor John Avalos told The San Francisco Examiner. \"\"Probably some of the wealthiest people in this country. And we are giving them more wealth.\"\" Last Tuesday, members of a neighborhood group protested outside Twitter's current headquarters, about a mile from the proposed new offices. They accused Twitter of not living up to its pledge to be a good neighbor. They complained neither the city nor the company have considered the low-income residents who would be adversely impacted by rising rents spurred by the prosperity Twitter could bring. \"\"The residents are feeling that if they're not going to benefit from this revitalization that the city is pushing for, it really doesn't make sense for these companies to stay in San Francisco,\"\" said Angelica Cabande, director of South of Market Community Action Network. Twitter declined to comment on the tax-break fracas. As a result of the controversy, a lawmaker on the Board of Supervisors' progressive wing, Ross Mirkarimi, has proposed an alternative measure he says will fix an underlying legal flaw that has led to anxiety among hot tech companies looking to grow. San Francisco's payroll tax is unusual enough, but one provision makes it even more unique. The city in 2004 added language to the tax code to make clear that tax collectors considered stock options a part of employees' compensation and hence taxable as part of the payroll. For tech startups, stock options are one of the most common ways to hold onto employees, especially when a lack of funds doesn't allow them to offer competitive salaries. When lucky companies reach a point where they can make their initial public offering of stock, those options can turn into a major windfall for workers. But for companies in San Francisco, that windfall sticks employers with a huge tax increase right at the time they've issued the stock in an effort to expand. Mirkarimi's proposal would place a two-year moratorium on taxing any company's stock options to ease the fears not just of Twitter, but other San Francisco-based startups like social gaming leader Zynga and consumer review website Yelp. \"\"You don't want to write law in a way that only helps one company or one neighborhood in one part of the city,\"\" Mirkarimi said. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the Twitter package, and Mirkarimi predicts it will pass even without his vote. If that happens, Service Employees International Union Local 1021, the public employees union, may seek a ballot measure that could delay the deal until voters weigh in. City economic officials paint any failure of the deal not as a loss to Twitter but as a loss for the neighborhood, where more than half of the available commercial real estate sits vacant. While Twitter is the big fish the city is seeking to catch, any businesses within the geographic zone defined by the legislation would get a similar tax break. \"\"The benefit we want, which is jobs in this area, is not happening without some incentive,\"\" said Jennifer Matz, director of the city's Office of Economic and Workforce Development. Without such incentives, she said, the neighborhood has not seen improvement for a generation. \"\"It resisted the last dot-com boom.\"\" ©2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Italian fashion's most powerful design duo have been told they will not stand trial for an alleged €1bn (£880m) tax dodge after a judge in Milan threw out the case against them at a preliminary hearing. The pair have built one of the world's largest fashion brands, beloved of celebrities such as Madonna and Kylie. They were accused of fraud of around €1bn as part of an inquiry into reports the company had failed to declare €840m in revenues. Both designers, Dolce's brother Alfonso and three other senior members of the company were accused but all denied the charges. Judge Simone Luerti ruled there was not enough evidence to take the Milanese designers to trial, and closed the file on other people who had been under investigation as well. The reported allegation was that Dolce & Gabbana created a company in Luxembourg in 2004 and 2005 which was given control of the group's two brands - the main label and its younger line D&G - so avoiding Italian taxes. It is unlikely that sales of their brand of \"\"molto-sexy\"\" clothes will have been affected by this near brush with scandal. Dolce and Gabbana are a superstar partnership - there are stores in 34 countries - who have masterminded an instantly recognisable high-end Euro-look. They are central to the Milanese fashion notion of \"\"more is more\"\". Alongside super-sexy ads, the brand's success has been based on its ability to sell well-tailored suiting and glitzy party dresses alongside more affordable branded items including T-shirts, jeans, perfume, sunglasses and makeup. This is not the first controversy Dolce and Gabbana have weathered. Three years ago, they came under fire over an advertisement that was accused of exalting gang rape: it showed a woman being held down on the ground by a man while other men looked on. In 2009, Giorgio Armani accused the couple of having copied a design for quilted trousers - a charge Dolce and Gabbana contemptuously dismissed. ' \n",

These declines, seen between 2003 and 2007, continue a trend that began in the 1990s, the researchers added. Importantly, this is the first time a drop in the rate of deaths from lung cancer among women has been seen, coming a decade after lung cancer death rates started declining in men, they noted. \"\"The drop in lung cancer rates among women is due to women quitting smoking,\"\" said report co-author Lynn Ries, a health statistician at the U.S. National Cancer Institute. \"\"Women started smoking a lot later than men, so the peak in the mortality rate occurred a lot later,\"\" she added. The report is the work of researchers at the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society. It is published in the March 31 online edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute . Although cancer rates are declining in adults, there has been a rise in cancers diagnosed in children. Most of these involve increases in the incidence of leukemias. However, the rate of death from cancer among children is declining, Ries noted. Ries noted that the reasons for the increase in childhood cancers isn't clear. Among men, the overall cancer rate has remained about the same. In fact, cancer rates in men would have also shown a decline, except for a small rise in the rate of prostate cancer, according to the report. One section of the report focuses specifically on both brain and nervous system cancers and benign tumors. According to the report, benign brain tumors are twice as common as cancerous ones, Ries said. In fact, benign brain tumors account for 75 percent of those in adults and 33 percent of brain tumors in children. \"\"Cancer is not one disease,\"\" Ries said. \"\"The rates for some are going up and some are going down, and there are different patterns for men and for women,\"\" she said. For example: Among men, rates of lung, colon, rectum, oral, pharynx, stomach and brain cancers have dropped. But, rates of kidney, pancreas and liver cancers and melanoma have risen. While, among women, rates of breast, lung, colorectal, uterine, cervical, bladder and oral cancers have dropped. But, rates of kidney, pancreas and thyroid cancers, and leukemias and melanomas, have risen. Racial disparities in cancer still exist, the researchers noted, and the cancer death rate is highest among black men and women, even though the cancer death rate for blacks dropped significantly from 1998 to 2007. In addition, the highest rates of new cancers seen between 2003 and 2007 was among black men. Among women, the highest rate was seen among white women, according to the report. Among both black and white women, breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer. These differences may be due to variations in risk behaviors, socioeconomic status and access to and use of screening and treatment, the researchers said. Dr. Joseph Rosenblatt, interim director of the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, attributes declining cancer rates and deaths to a variety of factors. The reduction in the rate of some cancers is mostly due to lifestyle changes, especially people not smoking, he said. On cutting the death rate, Rosenblatt noted that \"\"we have evolved better screening, better diagnostics and better classification of cancers and better treatments,\"\" he said. \"\"We are beginning to see significant decreases.\"\" On the other hand, \"\"we really don't have a good explanation for why childhood cancers have increased,\"\" Rosenblatt said. Most of the rise is in leukemias, and \"\"the good news is that most leukemias are curable in children,\"\" he said. Rosenblatt expects to see even fewer cancer deaths in the future. \"\"The treatments on the horizon are extraordinary,\"\" he said. This change is being brought about by better understandings of how different cancers work and then developing targeted treatments, Rosenblatt said. \"\"The war on cancer has been successful,\"\" he concluded.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Defense rests in Cuban ex-CIA agent's perjury case Defense rests in Cuban ex-CIA agent's perjury case (AP) EL PASO, Texas (AP) — Attorneys for an elderly ex-CIA agent accused of lying to U.S. immigration authorities about his alleged role in deadly 1997 bombings in Cuba rested their case Friday without calling their client as a witness. Luis Posada Carriles' attorneys called just eight witnesses in eight days — barely a third of the 23 people federal prosecutors summoned to the stand during the first 11 weeks of the oft-delayed trial. Prosecutors plan to call at least one rebuttal witness Monday, with closing arguments to follow. Posada's face is plastered on propaganda billboards throughout his native Cuba, where he is considered former President Fidel Castro's longtime nemesis for the decades he spent trying to destabilize Castro's regime and other communist governments in Latin America. For much of that time, he had Washington's support. Posada sneaked into the U.S. in 2005 and sought political asylum, and then U.S. citizenship. Prosecutors charged Posada with 11 counts of immigration fraud, obstruction and perjury, because they say he lied during citizenship hearings in El Paso about how he made it into the country and about having a Guatemalan passport with a false name. They also say Posada failed to acknowledge planning a wave of 1997 bombings at Cuban luxury hotels and a top tourist restaurant in Havana between April and September 1997 that killed an Italian visitor and injured about a dozen other people. In 1998 interviews with The New York Times, Posada said he masterminded the blasts, explaining that they were meant to hurt tourism in Cuba but not kill anybody. He also said he was angry the attacks had not received enough media attention in the U.S. He has since denied making those comments. The defense focused on attempting to discredit key prosecution witnesses, rather than telling Posada's versions of events. Its final witness was Carlos Spector, an El Paso attorney who has handled about 500 immigration cases, including some high-profile ones involving Mexicans who have fled to the U.S. amid their country's bloody drug war. Spector suggested U.S. authorities entrapped Posada simply by allowing him to go through immigration hearings. Posada was arrested in Panama in 2000 and imprisoned over a plot to kill Castro during a summit there. He was pardoned by the Panamanian president in 2004, and turned up in the U.S. the following March. Spector testified that Posada was barred by federal statute from receiving U.S. political asylum or citizenship because his previous conviction in Panama meant he couldn't demonstrate good moral character. All the other questions he was asked during the El Paso hearings, Spector said, including how he slipped into the country, what was his role in the 1997 Cuba bombings, and why he had a Guatemalan passport, were irrelevant. \"\"I don't know why they got that far,\"\" Spector said, \"\"his case was dead on arrival.\"\" The defense has long claimed the U.S. government knew Posada wouldn't qualify for citizenship but went ahead with the interview anyway just to charge him with lying. It's an argument that worked before. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone threw out original perjury and immigration fraud charges against Posada in 2007, chastising the government for using the immigration hearings to build a criminal case against him. That decision was overturned by an appeals court, however, and the case returned to Cardone in El Paso, where prosecutors added new charges of obstruction. Posada was denied political asylum and citizenship during the El Paso proceedings, but wasn't forced to leave the country under the convention to prevent torture. A U.S. immigration judge ruled he couldn't be sent to Venezuela or Cuba because he could be tortured, and no other nation would take him. Under cross-examination Friday, lead prosecutor Timothy Reardon stressed that Posada requested the citizenship interviews and, though he ultimately withdrew his application for asylum because of his Panamanian conviction, he didn't do so until after answering more than two days of questions voluntarily. The defense also showed a photograph of Posada in front of a Greyhound bus station, but provided no further information or details. Posada says he paid a people smuggler to drive him from Honduras through Mexico and over the Texas border to Houston in 2005, where he took a bus to Miami. Prosecutors say he actually sailed on a friend's yacht from the Mexican resort of Isla Mujeres directly to Miami, where he slipped ashore without contacting immigration authorities. A CIA operative until 1976, Posada participated indirectly in the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. He later served as head of the Venezuelan government's intelligence service and was arrested for planning the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people. He escaped from a Venezuelan prison while still facing trial, however. In the 1980s, he helped the U.S. funnel support to Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Since arriving in the six years ago, Posada spent about two years in immigration detention centers in and near El Paso — but was released when Cardone threw out the first case against him in 2007. He has been living in Miami since then. ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: '2 convicted of kidnapping slain US drug trafficker EL PASO, Texas (AP) - A jury on Friday convicted two men of kidnapping an American drug trafficker from his home near El Paso two years ago, five days before he turned up dead with his hands chopped off in a city across the border in Mexico. The West Texas Federal Court jury found Cesar Obregon-Reyes and Rafael Vega guilty of abducting Sergio Saucedo from his home on Sept. 3, 2009. They could be sent to prison for life when they are sentenced in July. Attorneys for both men said they would appeal. Prosecutors say Obregon-Reyes, Vega and a third man, Obregon-Ortiz, kidnapped Saucedo under orders of a Mexican drug cartel in what was a rare case of drug war violence spilling into the U.S. Saucedo's body was found on an unpaved street in Juarez, across the border from El Paso. Obregon-Ortiz, who gave incriminating testimony about the other two men after his arrest, pleaded guilty to undisclosed charges last week and will be sentenced separately, court documents indicate. Obregon-Reyes and Vega also were convicted of three other counts Friday, including conspiracy to kidnap and kill in a foreign country, and interstate and foreign travel in aid of racketeering. \"\"We are going to appeal, I think we have pretty good chance there,\"\" Vega's attorney, Robert J. Perez, said after the hearing. Friends and relatives of the defendants wept as they listened to the jury's verdict. \"\"Before this, I wanted to become a prosecutor. I wanted to work with the system. Now I'll become a defense attorney to defend innocent people like my cousin\"\", Vega's cousin, Maria Biddlestone, said after the hearing. During the trial, a bus driver testified that Obregon-Reyes was among a group of men she saw shoving another man into a sport utility vehicle. Two other witnesses testified that they heard Vega bragging at a party about the abduction and the money, car and drugs he received as payment. Prosecutors also presented an undercover recording in which the defendants were heard discussing a defense strategy and how Obregon-Ortiz had wronged them by talking to detectives. Defense attorneys argued that Saucedo's wife - who admitted on the witness stand that her husband was a drug trafficker - could not identify the kidnappers, and that it was therefore unlikely that the bus driver could do so after allegedly seeing the abduction for less than 10 seconds. A defense witness also testified that they never went to the party where Vega allegedly bragged about the abduction. They also cited excerpts from the recording in which Obregon-Reyes is heard saying that, when questioned by detectives about the kidnapping, he had told them he didn't do it. A convicted drug trafficker, testifying under an assumed name, said he and Saucedo had been distributing drugs in the U.S. for more than 16 years and that the owners of a 670-pound (300-kilogram) marijuana shipment that was intercepted at a Border Patrol checkpoint east of El Paso were angry at Saucedo for lying to them about the date it was seized.

The bright red food truck sat just yards (meters) from an elementary school where children were at gym class in an outdoor patio, said Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Panicked parents attending a meeting at the school grabbed their children and ran.

The burrito vendor's body was found inside the truck, while his son lay dead outside. A fifth man was wounded and taken to a hospital. Del Socorro said rumors swirled that a child from the school had been killed but she later learned he was the burrito vendor's son. \"\"He wasn't from the school, but imagine, he was a boy, an innocent boy,\"\" she said, adding that she didn't know whether she would take her son to school Monday. \"\"This city gets worse and worse.

Ciudad Juarez, a city across from El Paso, Texas, has been wracked by a turf war between the Sinaloa and Juarez drug cartels. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city of 1.3 million residents in 2010. Hours before the attack on the burrito truck, gunmen assaulted a bar in the same neighborhood. Sandoval said the death toll from that attack rose to 10 Friday after two more people died from their wounds. Sandoval said gunmen traveling in three cars arrived at the bar El Castillo late Thursday and opened fire. Police found more than 130 bullet casings at the scene. Children are increasingly falling victim to Mexico's viscous drug war, which has claimed more than 34,000 lives since President Felipe Calderon launched a military a crackdown on drug cartels in 2006. The nonprofit group Network for the Rights of Children in Mexico estimates 994 children and youths under 18 were killed between late 2006 and late 2010, and says the number has risen since then. A 17-year-old boy was among seven people killed in three shootings around Monterrey, a city in the northeastern state of Nuevo Leon where the Gulf and Zetas drug gangs are waging territorial battles. State Public Safety spokesman Jorge Domene said the teenager was gunned down in front of his girlfriend in downtown Monterrey. The motive for the attack was unknown. In the western state of Michoacan, meanwhile, four bullet-ridden bodies were found in different towns, state police reported. Two of the bodies were found with threatening messages signed by the \"\"Knights Templar,\"\" a new group that has claimed to be behind a recent spate of slayings in the Pacific coast state.

In western Colima state, prosecutors filed homicide and other charges against 15 people in connection with the assassination of a former governor, Silverio Cavazos. The federal Attorney General's Office said in a statement that it arrested and charged five people in the November slaying. Colima Attorney General Yolanda Verduzco said state prosecutors had charged an additional 10 people, although it was unclear if they had been arrested. Investigators have not identified a motive for the assassination. Cavazos, who governed Colima between 2005 and 2009, was gunned down while he chatted outside his home with an official from the current state government. ' \n",

The instance of a mentally perturbed father abusing his amazingly talented children is something that Detroit music fans, as well of the rest of the world, know all too well. Think legendary and groundbreaking group The Jackson Five who was one of Motown's most famous acts. Though they were not subjected to sexual abuse that the public is aware of, they were unfairly beaten and verbally abused for years by their father Joseph Jackson. Likewise, the lovable DeBarge family who grew up in Grand Rapids and Detroit, MI, reported accounts of verbal and physical abuse by their father. Etterlene DeBarge a.k.a Bunny, lead singer of the group DeBarge, even revealed that she was sexually abused by their father. Is there a correlation between child abuse and superstardom?

The rattled Sin City call girl said Markoff arrived at their rendezvous at a Waltham hotel in early 2009 claiming he was a cop, but she quickly spotted his phony badge and plastic zip ties. When an erotic masseuse was later murdered in Boston, she knew she dodged death. “It could have been me,” said Amber, whose last name is being withheld by the Herald. “I answered the door. I was fully dressed, of course. I greeted him, gave him a hug. He was kind of, like, weird. He was skinny, too. He didn’t act happy to see me,” she said. “I stepped back. I said, ‘Can I see your ID?’ He pulled out his ID, then he pulled out something that was supposed to look like a badge. I saw that he had those plastic handcuffs.” That’s when she quickly shut the door. “I was kind of like, wow. . . . Luckily, I got out unscathed,” she said. Markoff fled, and she called hotel security and changed rooms — but she never called the cops. Her telephone number is one of dozens Markoff, 24, dialed from prepaid TracFones, including the number of Julissa Brisman, 25, who was killed at the Marriott Copley Place on April 14, 2009, newly released law enforcement records show. A Herald review of Markoff’s records show the former Boston University medical student dialed dozens of phone numbers linked to online ads for escorts, strippers and other erotic services. Amber’s phone is among those listed, records show. Prosecutors said this week there’s no doubt Markoff was in the early stages of a serial killer rampage targeting ladies of the night in hotels from the Hub to Rhode Island. Markoff committed suicide in August while awaiting trial at the Nashua Street Jail. Amber said she was suspicious of a “cold” and “weird” Markoff because he said he was from out of town but provided a local phone number. She said she didn’t buy the cop story and refused to let him in her room. “He actually tried to rob me. . . . I said, ‘You’re not a (expletive) cop.’ I basically shot him down,” she said. “I’m 5 (feet), 9 (inches). I gave it back to him. He told me he was going to go downstairs and get a female cop to search me. . . . I was like, send her up. Send her up. I have nothing to hide. . . . He tried to push his way into my room.” Around the time she met Markoff, Amber said escorts were leaving warnings on message boards about a man claiming to be a cop who tied up women and robbed them in New York, Boston and Connecticut. “He was doing that for a long time. We knew of him for years. He started that when he was younger,” she said. “He was really confident in the fact that no one was going to tell on him. He was just so brazen, nobody actually reported anything until someone got killed.” Amber told the Herald the scores of escort calls Markoff made suggest he was “obsessed” with robbing working girls, who sometimes carry thousands of dollars when they travel. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he paid for medical school by robbing girls,” she said. “He was hooked. He probably had a whole lifestyle around robbing girls.” ' \n",

U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema denied a motion to dismiss the suit against Mohamed Ali Samantar, who was Somalia's defense minister, and later prime minister, in the 1980s under the regime of dictator Siad Barre. The suit against Samantar, who now lives in Fairfax, was first filed in 2004, alleging that he oversaw abuses committed as part of the government's campaign of repression against the Isaaq clan in the northern part of the country. The case has languished in the courts for nearly seven years. Brinkema dismissed the case in 2007, ruling that Samantar was entitled to immunity. But the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the case. And earlier this year the State Department, in a rare move, recommended to the judge that Samantar should not receive immunity, in large part because there is no longer a recognized central government in Somalia that can request immunity on Samantar's behalf. Following Brinkema's ruling on Friday allowing the case to proceed, Samantar's accusers will for the first time be able to question him in a deposition about alleged abuses, including killings and torture, against the Isaaq clan. \"\"This is a great day for justice,\"\" said Natasha Fain, a lawyer with the San Francisco-based Center for Justice and Accountability, which is representing the plaintiffs. \"\"For all this time the defendant has been saying he shouldn't even have to answer his accusers in court.\"\" One of the plaintiffs, Aziz M. Deria of Bellevue, Wash., who alleges that his father and other family members were killed by forces under Samantar's direction, flew across the country to attend Friday's hearing. He has traveled to Somalia several times to document abuses that occurred there. \"\"I really want this guy to answer our questions,\"\" said Deria, who acknowledged that efforts to hold Samantar accountable for his actions are not universally well received among the Somali community. \"\"Back home, authority figures are considered above the law.\"\" Joseph Peter Drennan, Samantar's lawyer, argued Friday that the case should be tossed out for several reasons, including an expiration of the statute of limitations. He also said the courts should not wade into what he argues is essentially a political dispute. Samantar has denied any wrongdoing and did not attend Friday's hearing, though many of his family members did. ' \n",

The advisers' 8-6 vote came in response to concerns, especially from parents, that the commonly used dyes might be linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in some children. The advisory panel made its recommendation based on the FDA's evaluation of existing data, as well as testimony from researchers. It was the lack of rigorous studies, as well as a lack of data, that prompted the panel to ask for more research into the issue and delay a recommendation on artificial food colorings, CNN reported. The issue pitted the food industry against some parents, public watchdog groups and academics who've long agitated for a closer look at the additives. The FDA advisers, concluding two days of hearings that featured parents, scientists and food-industry representatives, said there wasn't enough evidence to definitively say that food dyes contribute to ADHD. The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory panels, but it usually does so. Artificial dyes are added to many foods including JELL-O, Lucky Charms, Pop-Tarts, Nestles Butterfinger bars, Hostess Twinkies and Frito-Lay Doritos, to name a few, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The FDA does have regulatory authority over food additives. For example, in 1976, Red No. 2 was banned because it might be cancer-causing. This week's meeting was significant because it was \"\"the first time the FDA has acknowledged that food dyes may affect children in a limited way,\"\" said Dr. David Schab, a psychiatric researcher and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City. Schab, who was scheduled to testify at the hearing, called it \"\"a big step forward.\"\" The question the panel was dealing with was whether the dyes cause ADHD, or might they simply trigger some nonspecific behaviors, such as irritability and insomnia, Schab said. Jeff Cronin, a spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which has long lobbied for a ban on the dyes, said \"\"the evidence that artificial food dyes worsen some children's behavior is pretty convincing.\"\" Cronin had hoped that the FDA panel would recommend warning labels on foods with these additives, and encourage companies to switch to safer colorings. Given the studies done so far, Schab said he also favored eliminating artificial colorings from foods. \"\"I would like the FDA to eliminate dyes, but I would also be very happy if we would have a label warning, like the ones that protect Europeans,\"\" Schab added. \"\"Labels that warn that these dyes have potential detrimental effects on behavior.\"\" Based on its review of published studies, the FDA at this point said \"\"a causal relationship between exposure to color additives and hyperactivity in children in the general population has not been established.\"\" However, it did go on to say that for some children with ADHD and other behavioral problems, these dyes may exacerbate their problems. But dyes may not be the only food additive that has this effect, the FDA noted. On the other side of the debate, Brian Kennedy, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, contended that \"\"the safety of artificial colors has been affirmed through extensive review by the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority, and neither agency sees the need to change current policy.\"\" Kennedy added that \"\"all of the major safety bodies globally have reviewed the available science and have determined that there is no demonstrable link between artificial food colors and hyperactivity among children.\"\" Another industry voice said that food aesthetics matter to American consumers. In a statement, David Schmidt, president and CEO of the International Food Information Council, said that \"\"food colors add to our enjoyment of food by maintaining or improving their appearance.\"\" \"\"Without sufficient scientific evidence that a causal link truly exists between food colors and hyperactivity in children, communications that suggest a link could have unintended consequences, including unnecessarily frightening consumers about safe ingredients that are consumed every day,\"\" he said. \"\"Misguided theories dilute the impact of advice from health professionals on methods that have been found through scientific research to be truly effective in treating ADHD, such as medication and behavior modification.\"\" However, Dr. Roberto F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, believes the dyes could have neurological effects on children. \"\"The European Food Safety Authority has made it law that foods that contain these additives have a warning label,\"\" he said. \"\"This is already old news in the Old World.\"\" Lopez-Alberola said these dyes make foods more attractive, especially to children, and he speculates that part of the increase in ADHD and autism has resulted from food additives. \"\"It's not the sugar, it could well be these colorants,\"\" he said. Cronin, the spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said there are alternatives to chemical colorings. He said that when warning labels were put on foods in Europe, it caused many U.S.-based food companies to market natural-based food-colored products in Europe. More information ' \n",

They stressed that the radioactive materials found in grass clippings from upstate Will County and in Springfield air samples are in minuscule amounts, far below established safety levels. \"\"These levels are very low and present no hazard to people in Illinois,\"\" Jonathon Monken, director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, said in a statement. \"\"We will continue to track the deposition of radiation in Illinois to ensure there is no impact on public health and safety.\"\" Agency spokeswoman Patti Thompson said officials are now testing grass in Madison and Clinton counties and milk from local cows in Clinton and Bond counties, with additional testing in West Chicago and the Springfield area. The Metro East counties were chosen because of their proximity to the agency's Springfield facilities and the fact that they're not near any of Illinois' six operational nuclear facilities. In Missouri, officials of the state's Department of Health and Senior Services regularly monitor air, water and local milk, at monitoring sites in St. Louis, Jefferson City and Springfield. \"\"We have not received any reports of elevated radiation,\"\" said department spokeswoman Jacqueline Lapine. At least 15 other U.S. states have found trace levels of radioactivity apparently resulting from releases half a world away, at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power reactors. The reactors were severely damaged in the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and resulting tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, sparking worldwide concern about radioactivity. Thompson describes the radioactive levels found so far in Illinois as being about 200,000 times lower than the regulatory limits set for nuclear power plants. \"\"It was almost impossible to detect,\"\" she said. The intent with continued testing \"\"is to let people know we're watching for it ... and to make sure we don't see levels later that are of concern.\"\" Thompson said there is little doubt the readings are from the Japan disaster. \"\"This is a material that you really only find from a fission process, and this is the only thing we know of in the world with that kind of release.\"\" The material in question has an eight-day \"\"half life,\"\" meaning it loses half its radioactivity in eight days, and in effect will be gone in seven weeks.

A necropsy of the four-year-old bear who died suddenly two weeks ago showed he was suffering from encephalitis, an irritation and swelling of the brain that was likely brought on by an infection, pathologist Claudia Szentiks said. It remains unclear what that infection was, but Achim Gruber, a professor of veterinary medicine at Berlin's Free University, said it likely was a virus. Knut, who was born at the zoo, quickly rose to celebrity status as an irresistibly cute cub who had been rejected by his mother. Knut died March 19 in front of hundreds of visitors, turning around several times and then falling into the water in his enclosure. Experts who examined Knut found large quantities of fluid in his lungs, supporting the conclusion that the immediate cause of death was drowning.

The sharp reduction to $690 per dose came two days after the Food and Drug Administration publicly invited competition. The drug, a synthetic form of progesterone commonly called 17P and marketed under the trade name Makena, is recommended for women at high risk of delivering prematurely. The drug is administered via injection weekly for about 20 weeks. Friday's announcement by K-V Pharmaceutical Co. of a 55 percent price reduction puts the list cost of a full course of treatment at $13,800. That's down from $30,000 under K-V's old price but still a sharp jump from the $400 a woman could expect to spend if she had the drug made at a compounding pharmacy. Until this year, an FDA-approved version of 17P was not available. So the only alternative for women was to take a prescription for the drug to a compounding pharmacy that produced individual batches of it for $10 to $20 a dose. In February, the FDA granted K-V Pharmaceutical Co. exclusive rights to make Makena for seven years. K-V subsequently priced it at $1,500 a dose and sent letters warning compounding pharmacies of an FDA crackdown if they did not stop making their versions. The FDA reacted Wednesday, saying it wasn't planning on blocking compounding pharmacies from making the drug, essentially encouraging patients to go that route. K-V defended its pricing as justified by development costs. But the FDA noted K-V relied on a study by the National Institutes of Health to demonstrate the drug's effectiveness. ' \n",

The gunmen demanded freedom for their fellow tribesmen who were jailed following an almost identical hostage-taking in the same town in 2009 by suspects wanted for murder and abductions, said regional police chief Reynaldo Rafar. The assailants in the latest kidnapping are former government militiamen turned bandits who seized the hostages Friday at the graduation ceremony in Prosperidad town in the remote forests of southern Agusan del Sur province in the eastern part of Mindanao Island, Rafar said. The 14 adults include teachers and education department district officials, but there were also two children aged 10 and 13 in the group, according to Senior Inspector Joel Solon Mendez of the provincial police. Rafar said the gunmen immediately demanded the release of fellow Manobo tribesmen Ondo Perez and three others who are being held at the Agusan del Sur jail on charges of kidnapping and illegal possession of firearms in connection with the December 2009 hostage-taking, in which 47 villagers were held for several days. Police sharpshooters were deployed around the area where the hostages were held and negotiations were under way, Rafar said. The hostages were being kept in one or two houses near other houses owned by hostage takers’ relatives, said another police officer, Senior Supt. Nestor Fajura. Mendez said the estimated six gunmen holding the hostages had initially given a 24-hour deadline to release their four fellow tribesmen. But he said that as of Saturday morning, they appeared to have softened their position on the deadline and demanded that food and water be delivered to them. Government negotiators have in turn asked for the immediate release of the children. Fajura said as of Saturday afternoon none of the hostages had been released and the food had not been delivered because the gunmen made it a condition that detainee Perez be among those to bring it. \"\"The crisis management committee is now talking to Perez so he can ask the leader of the hostage takers who is his nephew not to include that condition,\"\" Fajura said, adding that it was impossible to quickly get a court order for Ondo’s release since it was a weekend. Food must have already been given to them, even if it may not be enough, he added. This latest hostage-taking took place seven months after a daylong kidnapping crisis in Manila ended in bloodshed. After a dismissed policeman took captive a busload of Hong Kong tourists to demand his job back, the Aug. 23 ordeal ended with police and the gunman opening fire, leaving eight hostages and the assailant dead and drawing international criticism to the police operation. \"\"I don’t think we need to say this anymore, but the safety of the hostages should be the priority,\"\" presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte said on government radio Saturday. She said the local crisis management committee involving the mayor and town officials \"\"hopefully can handle this without anything untoward happening to the victims.\"\" Police have said Perez and his men were former government militiamen who turned to banditry. They were accused of seizing the villagers in 2009 after two of Perez’s relatives escaped arrest in connection with the killing of four members of a rival clan. The 2009 hostages were freed several days later after intervention by Manobo tribal elders, and the gang leaders were arrested. © Copyright 2011 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

When prosecutors violate the law to deprive a person of a fair trial, is vindication enough, or should the prosecutors be held liable for damages? This week, a bitterly divided U.S. Supreme Court all but closed the door to such lawsuits. The 5-4 ruling came in the case of a New Orleans man who served 18 years in prison for a crime he did not commit. In December of 1984, Raymond Liuzza Jr., the son of a prominent New Orleans business executive, was shot to death in front of his home. Police, acting on a tip, picked up two men, Kevin Freeman and John Thompson. Thompson denied knowing anything about the shooting, but Freeman, in exchange for a one-year prison sentence, agreed to testify that he saw Thompson commit the crime. Prosecutors wanted to seek the death penalty, but Thompson had no record of violent felonies. Then, a citizen saw his photo in the newspaper and implicated him in an attempted carjacking - and prosecutors saw a way to solve their problem. John Hollway, who wrote a book about the case, said the solution was to try the carjacking case first. A conviction in the carjacking case would yield additional benefits in the subsequent murder trial, Hollway observes. It would discredit Thompson if he took the stand in his own defense at the murder trial, so he didn't. And the carjacking would be used against him during the punishment phase of the murder trial. It all worked like a charm. Thompson was convicted of both crimes and sentenced to death for murder. An \"\"Oh My God\"\" Moment Several years later, four young lawyers at the silk-stocking firm of Morgan Lewis in Philadelphia took on his case pro bono. But after 10 years and thousands of hours of work, they had lost all their appeals, including one at the U.S. Supreme Court. Two of the lawyers, Michael Banks and Gordon Cooney, flew to Louisiana. \"\"We were literally on our way from telling John that we had failed him as his lawyers and that he was going to die,\"\" Banks says. \"\"And we were on our way to tell his mother and his 17-year-old son that they should start planning for the execution.\"\" Banks was driving while his co-counsel checked their office voicemail and learned some astonishing news: Their investigator had unearthed, in microfiche files, a lab report to prosecutors in the carjacking. A swatch of fabric stained with the carjacker's blood had been tested and never produced to the defense. \"\"It is an \"\"oh my God\"\" moment,\"\" Banks says. He says that single discovery would unravel both cases. \"\"We still did not have evidence of Thompson's innocence, but now we knew the DAs had played very, very dirty pool, and we were determined to see if there was other evidence that we could get,\"\" he says. There was plenty. Further testing would show that the carjacker's blood was Type B; Thompson's was Type O. And, it turned out, one of the prosecutors had years earlier made a deathbed confession to a colleague that he had hidden the blood report from the defense. That confession, too, was kept secret. To The Supreme Court All of this would eventually lead to reversal for both convictions, and a new trial on the murder charge. At that trial, yet more evidence would be uncovered and presented to the jury. Previously undisclosed police reports showed witnesses at the crime scene had described the shooter as 6 feet tall with close-cropped hair. Thompson was 5-feet, 8-inches tall with a huge Afro. The description, in fact, fit not Thompson, but Freeman, the man who had made the deal to testify against Thompson. In all, there would be 10 pieces of exculpatory evidence that prosecutors failed to turn over to the defense at the first murder trial. At the second trial, a jury acquitted Thompson after just 35 minutes of deliberation. Thompson then sued New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick and his office for failure to train prosecutors about their obligation to turn over such evidence to the defense. Connick's office had previously been chastised by the Supreme Court for similar failures. A jury awarded Thompson $14 million in damages. But this week, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned that award. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the five-justice majority, said there was no proof of a pattern of indifference in the DA's office and that prosecutors, unlike police, do not need special training in such matters because they learn the rules in law school. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took the unusual step of reading her dissent from the bench to underscore her view that the \"\"deliberately indifferent attitude\"\" in the DA's office had created a \"\"tinderbox,\"\" where miscarriages of justice were inevitable. Many saw her dissent as a call to Congress to change the law. \"\"That Is What's Scary\"\" Thompson says he's not bitter, saying he can't miss money he never had, but he says he is worried about accountability for prosecutors. \"\"I'm disappointed that from the Supreme Court ruling ... I didn't make things better. I might have made things worser,\"\" he says. \"\"It made them really think they got permission to kill now without being held accountable. That is what's scary.\"\" Connick, the district attorney, feels vindicated by the high court ruling. \"\"I think that he committed ... a murder, and I think that obviously we thought we had enough evidence to gain a conviction,\"\" he says. \"\"So I was delighted that the Supreme Court ruled in our favor.\"\" ' \n",

Menu labeling requirements proposed Friday by the Food and Drug Administration will require chain restaurants with 20 or more locations, along with bakeries, grocery stores, convenience stores and coffee chains, to clearly post the calorie count for each item on their menus. \"\"We've got a huge obesity problem in this country and it's due in part to excess calorie consumption outside the home,\"\" says Mike Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods. \"\"Consumers generally when you ask them say they would prefer to have that information.\"\" The new rules will apply to menus, both in restaurants and drive-through lanes. They will also apply to vending machines if calorie information isn't already visible on the package. The calorie counts will apply to an estimated 280,000 establishments and could be on menus by 2012. Required as part of health overhaul legislation signed into law last year, they are designed to give restaurant diners information that has long been available on packaged goods cooked at home. The FDA estimates that a third of calories are consumed by eating out. But don't expect calorie shock when ordering at the movie theater, where a tub of popcorn can contain well north of a thousand calories - movie theaters are exempt, along with airplanes, bowling alleys and other businesses whose primary business is not to sell food, according to the FDA. Movie theaters pushed to be left out after guidelines published last year included them. Alcohol will also be exempted, according to the agency. Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, says that could be misleading to consumers. \"\"I think it's going to be confusing if customers see the calories for soft drinks and juice labeled on the menu but not other drinks such as beer and wine,\"\" she said. \"\"It will make it seem like they are better choices.\"\" Still, Wootan says the guidelines are a positive step. \"\"You won't have to get out of line and go back to some poster by the bathroom and look at some item in a tiny font size,\"\" she says. \"\"It will be right there on the menu where you are getting your other information about what to order.\"\" The idea is to make sure that customers process the calorie information as they are figuring out what to eat. Many restaurants currently post nutritional information in a hallway, on a hamburger wrapper or on their website. The new law will make calories immediately available for most items. Menus and menu boards will also tell diners that a 2,000-calorie diet is used as the basis for general nutrition advice, noting that individual calorie needs may vary. The labeling requirements were added to the health bill with the support of the restaurant industry, which is facing a smattering of laws from cities and states. New York City was the first in the country to put a calorie posting law in place. Since then, California, Seattle and other places have done so. Dawn Sweeney, president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association, said the calorie postings will provide customers with consistent information. \"\"The new standard,\"\" she said, \"\"will help chain restaurants provide the same type of nutrition information to consumers in any part of the country.\"\" ' \n",

David Charles Schubert, 47, who prosecuted Paris Hilton after her arrest on cocaine charges last year, and most recently took on singer Bruno Mars, handed in his resignation yesterday after a ten years as a veteran prosecutor, two of which were spent as a liaison to a federal drug task force. But this all came crashing down when he was arrested on March 19 after Las Vegas police reported watching him - in a white BMW sedan - buy $40 worth of rock cocaine in a neighbourhood east of the Las Vegas Strip. Clark County District Attorney David Roger said he accepted David Schubert's resignation on Friday. Schubert is currently free pending a May 19 court date on felony conspiracy and cocaine possession charges. A telephone call to Schubert went unanswered. The street dealer Schubert allegedly bought the cocaine from claimed that the former prosecutor buys $40 of cocaine three or four times a week. A patrol officer stopped the deputy district attorney's BMW in Las Vegas when he spotted what he thought was a drugs transaction. According to an arrest report seen by TMZ, the officer watched Schubert pick up a black man from an apartment block, then drive to another address where he dropped him off. Schubert drove round for several minutes and then picked up the man again, police claim. The officer pulled the car over, but the suspected dealer jumped out and fled. Police gave chase and took him into custody. According to the arrest report, the man, named as Raymond Streeter, told officers he knew Schubert as \"\"Joe\"\". \"\"Joe\"\" had called him three or four times a week for the last six to seven months, Streeter claimed, given him $40 and driven him to an address to buy cocaine, the report alleges. Schubert was taken into custody and booked on cocaine possession charges. His two Las Vegas homes were searched and police took a blood sample, the Review-Journal reports. Mr Roger told 8 News Now: \"\"I just can't wrap my head around the idea that a prosecutor who knows the dangers of drugs would try crack cocaine.\"\" According to the Review-Journal, investigators are also looking into whether he may have compromised any previous cases. The prosecutor has worked for Clark County district attorney's office since 2002. He leads a state drugs task force and has been assigned some of its most high-profile cases. Mr Roger told the newspaper: \"\"It's disheartening to know the individual who I assigned to prosecute high-level drug cases is allegedly using rock cocaine.\"\" In February Schubert prosecuted the case against singer Bruno Mars - real name Peter Hernandez - who admitted to possessing cocaine in a plea deal. He was sentenced to a year of informal probation. And last year he prosecuted Paris Hilton, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanour charges after police found 0.8grams of cocaine in her handbag. Lawyer David Chesnoff, who represented both celebrities, told the Review-Journal he wouldn't speak badly of Schubert. He said: \"\"I'm a big believer in the Constitution. I believe everyone is innocent until proven guilty. And I always root for the underdog. \"\"I will say this: David's always been a real professional and always treated me with respect, so I wish him the best.\"\" Schubert also prosecuted the case of Steven Zegrean, who was convicted for shooting four people at the New York-New York casino in 2007. His case has been assigned to the attorney general. If found guilty, he could face up to four years in a Nevada jail. ' \n",

That's exactly what 57-year-old Jose Carlos Serna did, and each time he escaped from custody by the same method. His wife sent a fax to court officials, ordering that they release him, and they did what she commanded each time. In December he was in a cell at Arganda del Rey courthouse awaiting trial when officers received a fax purportedly from a regional court. It was followed by a phone call from someone claiming to be a court official, corroborating the release order. Officers did try to verify the order, but their calls went unanswered. When they received a second call, confirming Serena's release, he was freed and put into a waiting taxi. Both of the calls were from his wife, Gema Maria Serna, who police tracked down to a house in the northern suburb of San Lorenzo del Escorial. Last time Serna used the trick on police he escaped from Valdermoro jail. He was in prison after he headed a gang that kidnapped a Spanish businessman in 2008, holding him captive in the Portuguese beach resort of the Algarve. Since his last escape Serna had rented several houses, including the heavy fortified suburban home where he was arrested. Police said he had equipped the house with reinforced window protection and a secret entrance that could not be easily detected or approached. He had also hired a number of men to drive him around while pretending to be an Italian university professor.

Most of those kidnapped were teachers, but there were two children aged 10 and 13 in the group, officials said. Brital allegedly demanded the release of fellow Manobo Ondo Perez and three other tribesmen who are being held at the Agusan del Sur jail on charges of kidnapping and illegal possession of firearms in connection with the December 2009 hostage-taking, in which 47 villagers were held for several days. Speaking to negotiators by cell phone, Brital threatened “to make a sample” of the hostages if a rescue attempt was launched.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Giants fan remains hospitalized LOS ANGELES (AP) A savage beating by two men outside Dodgers Stadium has left a San Francisco Giants fan hospitalized and police urging any witnesses to step forward to help identify the attackers. The beating after Thursday's season opener between the Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers left the victim in critical but stable condition. Police late Friday released composite sketches of the two suspects, who were wearing Dodgers clothing. Investigators were also checking to see if any security camera captured the attack, but Detective Larry Burcher said so far they'd found \"\"nothing of great value.\"\" \"\"We're very confident there were witnesses, it happened immediately following the game when everybody was coming out,\"\" Burcher said. Police said the two men began taunting three men in Giants gear with expletives as thousands of baseball fans left the stadium after Thursday night's 2-1 Dodger victory, Detective T.J. Moore said. The Giants fans tried to distance themselves from their assailants, and two made it away from them, but one was struck with fists on the back of the head and as he fell, his head hit the ground in Parking Lot 2 on the third base side of the ballpark, Moore said. Both attackers then kicked the victim, who suffered a head injury, and ran, Moore said. The suspects fled in a four-door sedan driven by a woman with a male child passenger in the vehicle, Moore said. When the victim's friends turned around to look for him, they saw him on the ground and made their way back to him. Police paramedics on bicycles were the first to arrive to help the victim. An ambulance was called and the victim was taken to a nearby hospital, Moore said. The victim's name wasn't released, but KGO radio in San Francisco and the Santa Cruz Sentinel identified him as Bryan Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic from Santa Cruz. His brother-in-law, David Collins, told KGO that Stow, a father of two, has severe head injuries. \"\"It's sad,\"\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said before Friday's game against the Dodgers. \"\"It's a shame somebody's in critical condition because of a ball game. When they're out fighting in the parking lot, we've lost sight of what this is all about. Sounds like the guy got blindsided, too.\"\" The Dodgers said they were co-operating with investigators and wished the victim a speedy recovery. \"\"It is extremely unfortunate that this incident took place on what was otherwise a great day at Dodger Stadium for tens of thousands of fans,\"\" the team said in a statement. \"\"We're committed to having the most fan and family friendly environment in baseball and will continue to make that a top priority.\"\" The stadium has been plagued by opening day violence in the past. In April 2009, a man stabbed his friend in the stadium parking lot after the home opener, in which the Dodgers. Arthur Alvarez said he acted in self-defense and was acquitted by a jury. The West Coast rivalry began on April 18, 1958, the first game played in California after both teams had moved from New York. The Dodgers beat the Giants 6-5 in a game played before nearly 79,000 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. \"\"I was disappointed,\"\" new Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said about the Thursday attack. \"\"You don't want to see that. Everyone likes rivalries, but to me that's crossing the line.\"\" ' \n",

Steven Charles Leonard, 63, was shot by officers after he made clear actions toward them while running away in an apartment courtyard, according to a Salt Lake City Police news release. The man was taken to a hospital where he later died. Police also arrested Jason Gibson, 37, for suspicion of aggravated robbery and homicide and fleeing from police. The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on paid administrative leave, per department policy. The shooting occurred around 5:30 p.m. on Friday near 400 South and 1600 West, said police spokeswoman Lt. Melody Gray. Just after 5 p.m., officers responded to a report of an armed bank robbery at a Zions Bank at 400 South and 700 East, Gray said. A man entered the bank with a gun and demanded money. He fled in a black SUV driven by Gibson, police said. The SUV was spotted on 400 South near 800 West by an officer who attempted to stop it. A chase ensued, police said. Gibson later pulled over and surrendered to police, while Leonard got out of the SUV and allegedly fled on foot into an apartment complex courtyard where he was shot, Gray said. The shooting is under investigation by Salt Lake City Police Department homicide investigators and the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office. Leonard does have a criminal history, involving shoplifting and drugs, but nothing within the past few years. Copyright 2011 The Salt Lake Tribune. All rights reserved.

No group claimed responsibility. But police and politicians universally blamed Irish Republican Army dissidents who have repeatedly planted bombs underneath the private cars of off-duty police officers, particularly new Catholic recruits, in a bid to stop cross-community support for law and order. Until Saturday, such booby-trap attacks had badly maimed two other officers but killed nobody. It was the first lethal attack on Northern Ireland security forces in more than two years. The IRA dissidents have stressed their determination to target any Irish Catholics who join the Northern Ireland police force. Building Catholic support for the once Protestant-dominated police force is a central goal of Northern Ireland's peace process. \"\"Those who carried out this wicked and cowardly crime will never succeed in dragging Northern Ireland back to a dark and bloody past,\"\" British Prime Minister David Cameron said in London. And reflecting the exceptional political solidarity in Northern Ireland today, leaders from both the British Protestant and Irish Catholic sides of the community condemned the bombers and vowed to bring them to justice. \"\"While those behind this act seek to promote division and conflict, let us state clearly: They will fail,\"\" said Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who is the senior Catholic in Northern Ireland's four-year-old unity government. \"\"The process of peacebuilding will continue and the community is united in rejection of them.\"\" In Dublin, newly elected Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny called the killing \"\"a heinous and pointless act of terror.\"\" And his justice minister, Alan Shatter, vowed that \"\"no effort will be spared in bringing the perpetrators of this dreadful crime to justice.\"\" Many of the IRA dissidents live along the border in the Republic of Ireland. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a statement echoing the \"\"unequivocal condemnations\"\" by Northern Ireland politicians of the police officer's killing. \"\"The perpetrators of this cowardly act represent the failures of the past, and their actions run counter to the achievements, aspirations, and collective will of the people of Northern Ireland,\"\" Clinton said.

One in four British women is now wearing a size 18 or above. But as Radio 4 presenter Jenni Murray admitted in this paper last week, it is almost impossible to find clothes that are both big and beautiful. So is hiding away in shapeless sacks the only solution? It most certainly is not. As a fashion stylist who has dressed celebrities of all shapes and sizes, I've discovered that every - and I mean every - woman can look good. If you know where to look, there are some fantastic companies, both on the High Street and on the internet, that have finally woken up to the fact that curvier women don't just want to crawl away and hide. My number one rule is to ditch the hard-wired belief that plus-size means frumpy. Brave the High Street and (politely, of course) demand to be noticed. There are plenty of chains that go up to your size, from Marks & Spencer and Evans to Debenhams, New Look and Monsoon. If you can't face the tyranny of badly lit dressing rooms, there are countless online stores that you can peruse from the comfort of your living room. Simply Be, Marisota, Duo, Anna Scholz, Beige Plus and Ann Harvey are a few of the best - and even trendy boutique ASOS.com has launched a fashion-forward plus-size label, ASOS Curve. So here's my pick of what's on offer, as worn by our gorgeous model Nina (bust 36DD, waist 36in, hips 46in). Enlarge Highlight your body as you would your face. Put the darkest colour on your heaviest area, or use colour to create a slim panel down the centre of your outfit. This can be done with a dark cardigan over a lighter shift dress - but this flattering frock does the work for you. Camel and black dress £60, Star by Julien MacDonald at Debenhams; jacket £40, Dorothy Perkins; ring stack £7.50, Daisy & Eve at Evans; shoes £105, duoboots.com Enlarge You can wear stripes, capes and slim-fitting trousers - it's just about wearing them well. All stripes work, whatever your dress size, if they're broken up with layering. Team them with darker trousers and try a cardigan on top. Or wear under a fun and playful cape like this one, which hides larger hips. Cape £70 and jeans £30, both Asos Curve; striped top £8.99, New Look; necklace £125, Bulatti.co.uk; sunglasses £123, Miu Miu at David Clulow; shoes £120, Ted Baker; bag £60, vivaladiva.com Enlarge This season's catwalk featured a lot of print - and there's no reason for plus-size girls to be left out. Prints are a nifty way to disguise lumps and bumps. Tall girls can pull off large, bold prints, but something subtler like this suits everyone. Break up the print with jackets or cardigans in plain colours. China print long dress £75, Evans Collection at Evans; white shrug £19.50, Evans; necklace £10, Daisy & Eve at Evans; sandals £19.99, New Look Enlarge Do you have slim legs, but worry about your hips and thighs? You can still do fitted trousers like these combats - simply layer longer pieces over the top to disguise problem areas. This lightweight parka is thin enough to wear in summer and completes the combat look. Parka £42, simplybe.co.uk; trousers £28, Indigo Collection at Marks & Spencer; yellow sleeveless shirt £19.99, New Look; belt £6, Dorothy Perkins; scarf £89, Epice at Fenwick; earrings £6.50 (part of a multipack), Daisy & Eve at Evans; ring £69, Lola Rose; shoe boots £120, duoboots.com Enlarge GET OUT OF THE LEGGINGS RUT: Harem pants are a super-comfortable alternative to leggings. You have to be fearless to wear them as there will still be volume around your hips and bum - that's part of the silhouette. But if you keep the top half short, you'll emphasise your waist. If you're concerned about the jersey fabric revealing wobbly bits, wear control tights to smooth them out. White jacket £139, Anna Scholz; blush lace top £39.50, Limited Collection at Marks & Spencer; trousers £50, Monsoon; necklace £118, Lola Rose; earrings (part of a multipack) £6.50, Daisy & Eve at Evans; shoes £120, duoboots.com Enlarge This is a fantastic shape if you've got a big bum, and it's everywhere at the moment thanks to Mad Men. This dress has a lovely V-shape neckline which helps slim a big bust, and volume in the skirt to skim over your hips and thighs. With a dress this perfect, you can get away with a daring pattern like these thick stripes on the bottom half. Red dress £59, Per Una at Marks & Spencer; cardigan £48, Monsoon; shoes £89.95, modainelle.com THE BASICS... TROUSERS: Should be higher-waisted, ideally with a smooth front and the zip at the side. SLEEVES: Are either elbow or three-quarter length — keep your eye out for cover-ups to wear over strappy tops or dresses. Avoid cap sleeves as these cut your arm at the widest point. NECKLINES: Are more flattering when lower, but you can cover up with a jersey camisole (£5 up to size 24 at Marks & Spencer). SKIRTS: Should sit smoothly across the front. A kick-out at the knee will give a balancing effect. DRESSES: Should have a back zip, not a side one. Diagonal ruching across the body is always slimming. AND DON'T FORGET... ACCESSORIES: Go for big, bold pieces. Daisy & Eve at Evans do an excellent range, with bangles and rings in all sizes. Lola Rose (lolarose.com) has a great range of stretch bangles. Use long necklaces (adele-marie.com has a good selection) and scarves to draw the eye down your body. SHOES: Evans has a great in-store range of wide-fitting shoes (up to size 11) and Duo (duoboots.com) has boot styles in calf widths up to 50cm and an amazing selection of footwear in three width fittings up to size nine. GOOD UNDERWEAR: This is essential in order to achieve the smoothest, sleekest shape you can. Simply Be (simplybe.co.uk) stocks Gok Wan’s excellent shapewear and a good selection of large bras that look feminine. Pictures: Joel Anderson. Model: Nina Hartley/excel.

Or Cannes or Marrakesh. This was the postwar world of jazz clubs, existentialists, cheap travel, uncrowded streets, beautiful cars, artists and, of course, Paris couture. With his Rolleiflex, Mr. Dambier, who will be 86 on Tuesday, captured all of this with honest joie de vivre, publishing his fashion images in French Elle. And he worked with some of the era's great beauties: Suzy Parker, Dorian Leigh, Bettina, Marie-Hélène Arnaud, Capucine, Ivy Nicholson and a young Brigitte Bardot. I admit: his name was new to me. But when I saw some images online, I was attracted to his sense of color and the carefree quality of his fashion work, which nicely mingled sophistication with girl-next-door sex appeal. \"\"He shot for Elle in the \"\"50s,\"\" said Rachel Smith, the director of the Benrubi gallery. \"\"He's never really broken past that French sphere. I don't think he got the credit he deserves.\"\" Richard Avedon and Irving Penn, among others, dominate that era. Yet it's interesting that Mr. Dambier, like Avedon, was photographing in the streets, using Paris cafes and other scenes, and in a way that feels more natural and familiar than his American counterpart, who photographed for Harper's Bazaar and helped bring more action to fashion images. One of my favorites, from a 2008 monograph of Mr. Dambier's black and white images, shows the model Sophie Litvak at close range as she pays a taxi driver, her face framed by the raised collar of her coat and the opened flap of her handbag. This is the second exhibition of Mr. Dambier's work at Bonni Benrubi, which first heard about him 10 years ago through a colleague in London. Mr. Dambier lives in Provence, where he has run a bed-and-breakfast for many years. About nine months ago, Ms. Smith said, he mentioned that he also had color images. \"\"He said, \"\"I think I could get these negatives restored,\"\" \"\" Ms. Smith recalled with a light laugh. \"\"When we saw the scans, we were bowled over by the color.\"\" In the last decade, digital retouching has made everything look oversharp and perfect - and, as Ms. Smith said of the Dambier images, \"\"they're not perfect and that's why they're amazing. They have that sense of color that doesn't exist anymore.\"\" She added: \"\"He's just a complete find. He pulls these images out, like the girl in the polka-dot bathing suit, and you think, \"\"Where have you been hiding this?\"\" \"\" In addition to treating high fashion as a popular art, by photographing it in the street, Mr. Dambier's pictures of fresh-faced models at the beach (including one posed with a surfboard), seem to summon the \"\"60s.

Or so it used to be until the appearance of Bergdorf Goodman's spring shoe catalog. From the first item on, which is a crazy quilt of a Dries van Noten sandal that rings in at $920, it is clear that one should beware all enterprises requiring new shoes . Which is not to say that there isn’t the occasional bargain, such as a Manolo Blahnik ballet flat for $665 (!) But if you’re looking for the kind of footwear that will knock somebody’s socks off (e.g., Azzedine Alaïa's bootie, above), the new normal hovers around $2,000.

But Denise Van Outen took a few steps back in the \"\"Yummy Mummy\"\" stakes today when she stepped out in London wearing a very odd and unflattering outfit. The matchy-matchy ensemble fell short of the chic look the 36-year-old was going for. Denise wore a pair of high-waisted trousers that were cropped above the ankle and had a loud black and white print. While the cropped length could have shown off her ankles, the mother-of-one instead chose to wear a pair of peep-toe booties, which gave the illusion of stumpy legs. She then added a matching white blazer and black and white pussycat bow blouse and a black handbag. The odd look was a far cry from the pictures of Denise lapping up the sunshine at Le Royal Meriden hotel in Dubai last week. Wearing a skimpy paisley-print bikini, Denise, who gave birth to daughter Betsey last May, looked tanned and trim as she strolled on the waterfront and luxuriated on a yacht. The TV presenter had said in the past that she was in no rush to lose her pregnancy weight, but her patience has clearly paid off. Miss Van Outen has admitted that she had healthy meals delivered to her door following the birth of her daughter Betsy last May. She described the regime she followed, called Pure Package, as ‘a life-saver for tired new mums’. The entertainer, who is married to actor Lee Mead, 29, also hired a personal trainer, and said her role as Paulette in the West End musical Legally Blonde is equivalent to ‘a gym workout, seven times a week’. While pregnant, she insisted she was going to ‘take time’ getting back into shape, adding: ‘Not everyone springs back into pre-pregnancy shape like Gisele Bundchen. ‘With someone like Gisele, you just have to accept that she’s blessed with amazing genes... I’m not in any rush.’ ' \n",

But there is one trend that even the most svelte of figures can't seem to pull off - high-waisted jeans. Milla Jovovich, usually a knockout, made the misstep today when she was spotted in a pair of the offending trousers, which did nothing for her gorgeous figure. The 35-year-old stepped out in a light blue denim shade which made her look a lot larger than usual, paired with a cream fur coat and extravagant necklace. The unflattering outfit was the second sartorial slip-up in as many days for the star, who suffered an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction the night before. Milla accidentally exposed one of her nipples when she attended former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's 80th birthday gala at the Royal Albert Hall last night. If a supermodel finds the high-waisted jeans trend tricky to pull off, there's not much hope for the rest of us. Despite the unflattering cut - universally hated by men - the style has remained on trend for another season. Amy Adams is another celebrity fan and was spotted in the trend last week in Los Angeles. And despite not being a model, the actress managed to pull of the look with a little more success than Milla. Amy's Seventies-style jeans were a darker shade and had pockets on the front, which helped to elongate her silhouette. Amy, 36, has regained her slender frame almost a year after the birth of her first child, daughter Aviana. The high-waisted jeans clung in all the right places on the Oscar-nominated actress, who had teamed the denim with a red scoop-neck T-shirt. Also spotted sporting the Seventies look recently was model Bree Henley, but she went the whole hog in full on hippy-chick mode as she teamed the jeans with a gold sequinned jacket. Again, the light-coloured denim was a bit of a fashion fail for even Bree' slight figure, making her look far larger than usual. Do you have a story about a celebrity?

April 1 (Bloomberg) - Hermes International SCA, the French maker of Birkin and Kelly bags, is in talks to sell its stake in the Jean-Paul Gaultier fashion house less than a year after the designer relinquished his role at the luxury-goods maker. Hermes received “an expression of interest from potential buyers” of the 45 percent holding, the Paris-based company said today in a statement, without elaborating. PPR SA is one candidate that may study the sale of the stake, French daily Les Echos said today, without citing anyone. Gaultier stepped down last year as the artistic director of Hermes’s women’s ready-to-wear unit after seven years in the role and was replaced by Christophe Lemaire. The designer has had a relationship with Hermes since 1999, when the company bought a 35 percent stake in his fashion house for $23 million. The stake was later raised. Hermes may need to raise funds for expansion to help fend off LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA after its rival acquired a 20 percent stake, according to Armando Branchini, vice- president of Milan-based consulting firm Intercorporate. Gaultier is seeking capital to develop and mandated Aforge Finance to study options, Les Echos said. “Luxury companies are increasingly focusing on their core business,” Branchini said. “Also, because of the attack from LVMH, Hermes needs all the liquidity it can get for store openings and other investments.” The value of the business would be based mostly on the royalties from Gaultier perfumes, he added. Valuations Valuations of Gaultier’s fashion house vary from several dozens of millions of euros, according to unidentified possible buyers, to several hundred million euros, according to unidentified people close to the founder, Les Echos reported. Hermes fell 5 cents to 154.65 euros at 10:45 a.m. in Paris trading. LVMH disclosed it held an Hermes stake in October. It built its holding without the knowledge of the company’s founding family, which controls more than 70 percent of Hermes. The family shareholders have bolstered their defense against a possible LVMH takeover. Gaultier’s departure from Hermes marked the end of a formal arrangement that began when Jean-Louis Dumas, former president and chief executive officer of Hermes, signed the designer up to bring new blood to the maker of luxury handbags and silk ties. The French couturier is best known for designing the cone bra worn by singer Madonna on her 1990 Blond Ambition tour. Charlotte Judet, a spokeswoman for PPR, didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment on the Les Echos report. - With assistance from David Whitehouse in Paris, Thomas Mulier in Geneva and Armorel Kenna in Milan.

Jewell : It goes without saying that the music industry definitely plays a part in the overall style. Of course, country music has an impact (which rocks and I would like to see more of it). But a lot of people don't know there's an amazing indie/rock community here as well. Brilliant local musicians playing in tucked-away historic venues and residential basements are influencing looks inspired by \"\"40s military, \"\"80s club and British punk while standing shoulder to shoulder with Southern Belles sporting vintage summer dresses perfectly complimented by their favorite pair of worn in cowboy boots. Boise street style CNN : What styles are popular right now? Jewell : It's hard to put my finger on a specific look that seems dominant, but mixing in vintage pieces is very popular among the people I photograph. There are some great thrift stores and locally owned boutiques that offer affordable one-of-a-kind Southern pieces scattered all throughout the city. You could compare Nashville to L.A. in the sense that a large majority of people who move here have come in hopes of breaking into the entertainment industry. The end result is a community of aspiring artists and service professionals who have a more eclectic sense of style than you would expect from people serving you cocktails or manning the register at your favorite local record shop. CNN : What do people wear on a night out? Jewell : Weekend nights have been a bit more on the grunge side lately. Black-and-white striped tops, muscle tees, biker jackets, denim or leather vests, fur jackets. Converse All-Stars, ropers and Beatle boots. Whether it's a fedora or something more summery, hats are staple pieces as well. CNN : Where do you shop in Nashville? Jewell : I would have to say my top picks for clothing are Goodbuy Girls and Local Honey. For shoes, I'm a big fan of the locally run Etsy shops, Granny's Bootery and Reanimated Rags. For accessories, I like Pangaea. CNN : How can fashionistas on a budget look great? Jewell : Thrift! Or learn how to sew. ' \n",

The Hong Kong stock exchange approval - according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter - does not stipulate any deadline for Glencore to launch the IPO, but it is an important step toward it. Glencore is considering a dual listing in London and Hong Kong. Amid recent market turmoil Hong Kong's approval is the strongest hint yet that the company will still proceed. Glencore declined to comment. Glencore's listing application was considered by the Hong Kong exchange at a scheduled meeting on Thursday. Glencore, valued earlier this year by one analyst at about $60 billion, is looking to ditch its long-standing partnership structure in favor of continuing as a public company, which would make it easier to reward partners and conduct acquisitions. The company has kept its listing plans under wraps since briefing analysts last month. It set an April 1 deadline for the sell-side analysts it briefed to complete their research notes. Glencore is not required to come back to the Hong Kong listing committee unless there are material changes to its situation. The next key step is the release of Glencore's much-anticipated intention to float document in London, expected by some sources to follow on the heels of the Hong Kong stock exchange approval. The London leg of the IPO will take longer to complete. The sources declined to be identified as the IPO discussions were confidential. A Hong Kong exchange spokesman declined to comment. CORNERSTONE INVESTORS Glencore has met with several key potential investors from Asia to the United States to gauge interest for the IPO and the response has been positive, sources previously told Reuters. If it decides to proceed with the offer, Glencore will aim to launch the retail portion of a Hong Kong IPO in the third or fourth week of April, with a listing scheduled for early to mid May, sources said. Asia's biggest sovereign wealth funds and some Hong Kong billionaires are seen as likely to invest in the IPO. Such so-called cornerstone investors are common to many large Asian IPOs and are assured a significant portion of the float. Cornerstone investors usually have a lock-in period of up to one year. They bring more credibility to the IPO, which in turn helps the underwriters to generate more demand for the offer.

      "Warning! Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Click to Buy Vogue Bag as Magazines Become E-Tailers (Corrects website name in 21st paragraph.) April 1 (Bloomberg) - Vogue and Elle have long influenced what clothes and handbags image-conscious consumers buy. Now, in a bid to reverse flagging sales and stay relevant, fashion magazines may sell the products they feature in their articles. As Apple Inc.’s iPad and other mobile devices change the way people stay informed and shop, e-commerce is creeping onto editorial agendas. Fashion magazines that have gone as far as to add links on their websites to online vendors such as Yoox SpA, may integrate the reading and buying experience, a move that would transform the likes of Vogue and Elle from just trendsetters into virtual shopkeepers. “Gone are the days when consumers want to flip through the back of a magazine to find an index,” said Shannon Edwards, European director of online shopping portal ShopStyle. Combining retail and editorial “is natural from an economic standpoint and natural from a consumer standpoint.” Hearst Magazines, publisher of Cosmopolitan and Esquire, will introduce “a series of e-commerce partnerships” this year, according to David Carey, president of the unit of New York-based Hearst Corp. Vogue, Conde Nast Publications’ flagship fashion title, allied last month with Yoox, the Italian Internet clothing and accessories retailer. Fashion magazines, grappling with a slide in circulation and advertising revenue, are looking to claw back ground lost to shopping websites such as Asos Plc and Net-A-Porter - owned by Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA - that are winning sales and influence. Fashion brands are also elbowing their way into the market, introducing digital titles like LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA has done with Nowness. Fading Fortunes “Fashion magazines are fighting for their lives,” said Uché Okonkwo, executive director of Luxe Corp., a consulting firm based in Paris. About $1.57 billion was spent last year on apparel and accessories ads in U.S. magazines - down from more than $2 billion in 2008 - as luxury goods companies cut budgets or put funds elsewhere, according to the Association of Magazine Media. Both Hearst and Conde Nast closed magazines during the global economic crisis. At Time Inc., the publisher of InStyle and Essence, publications’ ad revenue plunged 22 percent in 2009 and rebounded only 3 percent last year. Paris-based Lagardere SCA, which owns Elle, saw a similar weak recovery in 2010 after a 24 percent drop a year earlier. Fashion magazines’ print circulation is flat or falling as more readers move online. Vogue’s circulation fell 1.5 percent in 2010 to about 1.25 million. Elle’s slid about 0.5 percent to 1.11 million, Audit Bureau of Circulations figures show. Net-A-Porter Meanwhile, sites such as Net-A-Porter are gaining ground. Founded in 2000 by former fashion journalist Natalie Massenet, Net-A-Porter was acquired last year by Richemont and features catwalk footage, style tips and designer interviews as well as a catalogue of clothes and accessories. “It’s a kind of fashion magazine of the future,” said Hearst’s Carey. “We have to find a way to respond to that.” Turning into e-tailers may be challenging for magazines. In addition to logistical and technological hurdles, magazines may have to contend with an erosion of editorial independence. Fully integrating shopping into editorial content would mean allowing readers to jump from a handbag or shoe in a photo spread to a page offering it for sale in a single click, rather than forwarding them elsewhere for purchases. That “may be breaking the rules a little bit,” if advertisers are directly involved, said Jonathan Reynolds, a professor at the University of Oxford’s Institute of Retail Management. ‘Substantial Challenge’ Adding content to e-commerce is easier than adding e- commerce to content, according to Okonkwo. EBay Inc. hired a former editor at Conde Nast’s Lucky and Heart’s Harper’s Bazaar magazines as creative director for its fashion portal. Building the logistics and technology required for e-commerce would be “a substantial challenge” for Vogue, Okonkwo said. “Vogue isn’t built to sell products,” she said. That partly explains why magazines haven’t done more than add links to fashion brands’ e-commerce websites. Harper’s Bazaar partnered with Net-A-Porter last fall to pick out bags, shoes and clothing available from the shopping site with a single click. Vogue Italia and Yoox followed last month, focusing on products by young designers that could be bought from Yoox’s multibrand shopping site thecorner.com. It’s not clear how revenue from the online transactions will be divided between the partners. Maurie Perl, a spokeswoman for Conde Nast, declined to comment, while Michael Volpatt, a spokesman for Hearst’s digital operations, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Monetizing Trust Because readers trust recommendations by magazines, “we have to find the proper ways to monetize that,” Hearst’s Carey said. Yoox’s alliance with Vogue Italia “wasn’t a one-off,” said Federico Marchetti, chief executive officer of Yoox, declining to comment further. Determining who gets control of or access to user information - credit-card details, addresses, and surfing and shopping histories that can be used to target advertising and offers - may represent a major hurdle. Retaining data “from a significant number of people means you’re in business for anything you want to sell,” said Alex Wisch, a Standard & Poor’s Equity Research analyst in London. Consumers will take time to adjust to the change, according to Jean-Michel Noir, CEO of Redcats, the online fashion and home-furnishings retailer owned by PPR SA. Redcats operates two sites for its Vertbaudet brand, one of which is content-based and the other which sells products. “We haven’t merged them,” Noir said. “I’m not saying this is the way we will look at things forever but it’s not that easy to do everything on one site.” Still, sliding ad revenue may force fashion magazines to do just that, Oxford’s Reynolds said. “I think magazines are looking at the ad revenue shortfall, and saying, ‘we need to do more.’” - Editors: Vidya Root, Celeste Perri To contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Roberts in Paris at aroberts36@bloomberg.net; Matthew Campbell in Paris at mcampbell39@bloomberg.net.

Wait, it's Jean Paul Gaultier? Or Olivier Theyskens? Oh my God, when will they announce the replacement so we can rest easy that Dior will still be carried in stores and photographed in magazines?! Of course, the label is doing just fine. At a shareholders' meeting for Dior yesterday, LVMH chief Bernard Arnault announced that Dior's large design team is functioning smoothly without a creative leader for now, and that they'll name Galliano's successor when they feel like it. As evidenced by the label's fall collection, which walked at its scheduled time without a hitch and received perfectly decent reviews, there's a large and capable group of people behind the Dior label who can steer the ship. Also, Dior's revenues were up a solid 15 percent in the year 2010, so people are obviously still buying the label. Reports Women's Wear Daily : “Nothing has been decided,” said Arnault, explaining that Dior would see a number of candidates and then reflect on its options — with no specific deadline in mind, and only taking a decision when “conviction” arrives. In the interim, Dior’s design studios would soldier on making collections. “They are effective, creative and accustomed to doing so,” he assured. “The calendar will be respected,” added Dior chief executive Sidney Toledano, suggesting Dior will not shun the Paris runways, even absent a creative leader. In the meantime, Arnault seems even gleeful about the guessing game that even his own shareholders are playing: Told by one shareholder Dior might consider French couturier Jean Paul Gaultier, who recently wrapped up a seven-year stint as the women’s ready-to-wear designer at HermÃ¨s, Arnault replied merrily: “I’ll note your suggestion.” Let's not forget, this is the guy who kept his Hermजs purchases hidden from the company itself, so it's safe to say he can play his cards close to his chest.

The Queen of Burlesque was looking far from her glamorous stage self as she popped to the shops L.A. with her boyfriend. The 38-year-old performer and model was cruising around in a burgundy 1946 Super Deluxe Ford coupe and was clearly enjoying a relaxed day in an outfit that was less sexy seductress and more washerwoman. Dita soaked up the sunshine with the roof of her car down with her boyfriend French model and aristocrat Louis Marie De Castelbajac. The model kept her creamy skin undercover shielded with a headscarf in-keeping with the retro scene. But while we are used to seeing Dita in highly provocative outfits she opted for a much more understated look as she popped to the shops with her man. Dita had donned a midi-length black dress with multi-colored flowers and plants print and as usual was sporting her signature bright red lipstick. Louis-Marie, 27, also fitted in with the casual retro look in a plain white T-shirt, a pair of brown trousers and blue and brown brogues. The pair have been dating since April 2009 and Louis-Marie comes from one of the oldest and most prestigious families in France which dates back over 1000 years. His mother is an American writer and his father, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, is a world famous fashion designer. As well as visiting Alberton’s to pick up some supplies the pair also cruised through Griffith Observatory in L.A. – where on bemused fan spotted the star. The burlesque dancer confirmed her location on Twitter and posted to the fan: ‘that's where I take my vintage cars out for a cruise!’ Dita glammed up for the Vivienne Westwood store opening party in L.A. on Wednesday night and oozed timeless style in her black taffeta gown. The Burlesque performer teamed the Vivienne Westwood dress with a pair of gloves, her signature bright red lips and a feathered fascinator. Do you have a story about a celebrity?

That much-anticipated evening gala took place here on Thursday evening, with a black-tie affair that was attended by more than 600 guests, including artists, business tycoons, fashionistas and movie stars – from East and West. Wendi Murdoch was there, talking about her new film, set partly in Shanghai, \"\"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan.\"\" Jessica Alba flew in from Hollywood. China's own movie and fashion stars, Zhang Ziyi and Du Juan, were also on hand, as was the Academy Award-winning composer Tan Dun and Pearl Lam, Shanghai's most famous art and design connoisseur. Barry Diller, the American business tycoon and Ms. Von Furstenberg's husband, was seen in the company of Chinese business tycoons, while Charlie Rose, interviewer of the powerful and interesting, milled around close by. The gala was unusual because it was held on the grounds on an old pipe factory outside of Shanghai. The massive complex is now the studio of one of China's wealthiest and most celebrated artists, Zhang Huan. For one night, Mr. Zhang's studio — one of the world's largest — was draped in red curtains, bamboo scaffolding and battery operated LED lights, creating a sumptuous, glittering and even bizarre set of stages and evening lounges. Hundreds of red paper bags lighted by candles created a red-carpet effect near the entrance. Chinese lanterns had Ms. Von Furstenberg's iconic design prints. And red jars were arranged on the grounds in the shape of the DVF logo. Organizers said the gala was largely the work of the French fashion and furniture designer Alexandre de Betak. Mr. de Betak used brick, bamboo, paper lanterns and even an authentic Ming Dynasty temple (once used for the set of an opera Zhang Huan directed) to serve as the set for a riveting dance performance arranged for the gala by the Chinese dancer and choreographer Jin Xing. Mr. Zhang, the artist, made his own contributions. He placed two of his massive Buddha-shaped sculptures at opposite sides of the main factory floor. And for much of the night, as the guests walked around, 100 young men dressed in black costumes and wearing masks waved laser lights to create a light-show effect. \"\"I had to train the guys to use those lasers,\"\" Mr. de Betak said after the show. \"\"It was all absurd in a way.

But officials in Broken Arrow, east of Tulsa, say the kangaroo is in violation of a city ordinance banning exotic and wild animals. In an interview with CBS affiliate KOTV, Carr said she is not trying to break the law and in fact brought the animal to the attention od the city. Carr is seeking an exemption from the Broken Arrow City Council to keep the 25-pound great red kangaroo that she cares for much like a child. Irwin - named after \"\"Crocodile Hunter\"\" Steve Irwin - rides in a car seat, is dressed in a shirt and pants each day and is rarely away from his doting caretaker. At the advice of her therapist, Carr began volunteering at a local animal sanctuary, where she met the animal, then just a baby. Less than a week later, the kangaroo ran into a fence, fracturing his neck and causing severe brain damage. Carr volunteered to take the animal home and, while nursing him back to health, developed a bond. Irwin cannot stand or walk on his own, although he is slowly gaining back mobility and can hop three or four times in a row with assistance, she said. \"\"Irwin will not live if I have to give him up,\"\" Carr said, adding that she would rather leave town. \"\"I can't imagine a day living without him.\"\" Native to Australia, healthy male great red kangaroos can grow up to 7 feet tall, weigh more than 200 pounds and bound 25 feet in a single leap. But because of his accident, Irwin isn't expected to get larger than 50 pounds. Carr told KOTV that Irwin will be mobile, but that \"\"he won't get anywhere very fast.\"\" His veterinarian, Dr. Lesleigh Cash Warren, wrote in a letter to the council supporting Carr's request to keep him. Neutering has also lessened any chance he will become aggressive. Carr's therapist certified the animal as a therapy pet under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Carr, who is unable to work because of her health, makes sure the animal never leaves her side for more than an hour, often accompanying her on errands and going out to eat. Broken Arrow Mayor Mike Lester said he worries what could happen if Irwin is able to regain full mobility. The council last week delayed considering the issue until an April 19 meeting, to give City Attorney Beth Anne Wilkening and other staff time to research the issue. \"\"There's just a myriad of things we need to consider,\"\" Lester said. Every exception made sets a precedent, and the council must take that into consideration, Wilkening said. The council may decide to create an exotic animal review committee that would look at each animal on a case-by-case basis, he said. ' \n",

Italian fashion's most powerful design duo have been told they will not stand trial for an alleged €1bn (£880m) tax dodge after a judge in Milan threw out the case against them at a preliminary hearing. The pair have built one of the world's largest fashion brands, beloved of celebrities such as Madonna and Kylie. They were accused of fraud of around €1bn as part of an inquiry into reports the company had failed to declare €840m in revenues. Both designers, Dolce's brother Alfonso and three other senior members of the company were accused but all denied the charges. Judge Simone Luerti ruled there was not enough evidence to take the Milanese designers to trial, and closed the file on other people who had been under investigation as well. The reported allegation was that Dolce & Gabbana created a company in Luxembourg in 2004 and 2005 which was given control of the group's two brands - the main label and its younger line D&G - so avoiding Italian taxes. It is unlikely that sales of their brand of \"\"molto-sexy\"\" clothes will have been affected by this near brush with scandal. Dolce and Gabbana are a superstar partnership - there are stores in 34 countries - who have masterminded an instantly recognisable high-end Euro-look. They are central to the Milanese fashion notion of \"\"more is more\"\". Alongside super-sexy ads, the brand's success has been based on its ability to sell well-tailored suiting and glitzy party dresses alongside more affordable branded items including T-shirts, jeans, perfume, sunglasses and makeup. This is not the first controversy Dolce and Gabbana have weathered. Three years ago, they came under fire over an advertisement that was accused of exalting gang rape: it showed a woman being held down on the ground by a man while other men looked on. In 2009, Giorgio Armani accused the couple of having copied a design for quilted trousers - a charge Dolce and Gabbana contemptuously dismissed. ' \n",

The silk shirt has conquered every kind of wardrobe, and now retailers are urgently restocking to keep up with demand. \"\"It is a huge trend,\"\" said Jane Shepherdson, chief executive of Whistles. \"\"Sales are up 200% for us, and it's massive for all retailers at the moment.\"\" At mywardrobe.com, buying teams are also reporting phenomenal sales and have reacted by drastically increasing their orders. Such hasty recalibration of stock levels reveals that, while industry watchers had anticipated the trend, which started last autumn, the success of the silk shirt has gone way beyond expectations. Ruth Chapman, owner of Matches, a small chain of luxury boutiques, said she had noticed a correlation between the recession and the silk shirt's success. \"\"We have found that the current economy really focuses the mind of our customers. They are spending, but they are looking for the best possible design and fabrics and something that will stand the test of time. A silk blouse offers all these things. We cannot keep them on the floor at the moment and having just finished the buy for next autumn, they are not going away.\"\" On Friday in central London the silk shirt was everywhere. Indeed Erin Gunn, a 24-year-old sales adviser, was wearing two. \"\"Both are by Acne: the one on top was £125 from the Outlet and the one underneath was £180. I love how comfy and airy they are while still being smart.\"\" Namha Sekhri, a student, also admitted owning several. \"\"I have about five or six. I love them because they're elegant and feminine, and can be the centrepiece of your outfit,\"\" she said. Unlike some of the more niche trends that the fashion industry often promotes, silk shirts have a broad demographic appeal. \"\"It's across the board,\"\" Shepherdson said. \"\"Women in their early 20s are wearing them buttoned right up to the neck, while women in their 50s have a few buttons open and wear a piece of jewellery with it.\"\" Last year's relaunch of the Equipment label, a brand started in the 1980s by Christian Restoin - partner of the ex-editor of French Vogue, Carine Roitfeld - helped kickstart the trend. The label's signature silk blouses with two front pockets, which cost over £200, are seen as the pinnacle of the look, while cult brand Hamilton-Paris's collection revolves around the silk shirt. And yet when incomes are squeezed, Shepherdson said: \"\"They can be all things to all people; they go with everything, either at work or an evening event, so they represent great value.\"\" Silk shirt devotee Bridget Cass, a 58-year-old charity worker, yesterday confirmed the longevity of this trend - and its potential pitfalls. \"\"I inherited this shirt from my mother, who inherited it from my grandmother. I have four or five in this style and they are incredibly easy to wear. I do hate that they crease and stain so easily, though.\"\" ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Unveiled: Thirty years of big, fat celebrity weddings In 1981, as Britain was in the midst of a biting recession, Lady Diana Spencer married Prince Charles, while the world watched. Elizabeth Emanuel, designer \"\"Until Diana's dress, wedding gowns had been uniformly the same: white, ankle-length, A-line, long-sleeved. We brought the wedding dress into high fashion. Diana was introduced to us by Vogue; she didn't yet have her own sense of style, but she loved the very theatrical, fairy-tale dresses we made. When she asked us to make her wedding dress, it was life-changing. She told us to be secretive, but there were no instructions from Buckingham Palace, no protocol. There was so much speculation in the press after she wore a gown of ours to an official dinner, the Palace was forced to make an announcement through Reuters. The whole world went mad. There were photographers at the studio constantly and we had to take on security. We left false trails for the tabloids in the rubbish bins and we locked the dress in a trunk every night. We even made a spare dress in case our real design was leaked. On the day itself we realised this wasn't just a wedding dress, it was a moment in history. We dressed her at Clarence House, with the bridesmaids and the Queen Mother. Diana was excited but very calm. There was a moment, waiting for the coach, when we all stood in total silence for what seemed like an age. Then she stepped into the carriage and the crowds went mad.\"\" Nicky Haslam, interior designer and writer \"\"Princess Diana's wedding was extraordinary because it was a royal wedding. One thinks of watching the coronation on newsreels, there's this incredible formality to it, which doesn't exist now. It was certainly very traditional. There was a ball afterwards, given by the Queen, but Prince Charles and Princess Diana weren't there. In those days, the bride and groom left after their reception and went on honeymoon. To give a dance the night of your wedding was seen as incredibly bad form. The last thing you wanted was the bride getting reeling drunk so she couldn't consummate her marriage.\"\" Bruce Oldfield, designer \"\"The Eighties was a showy decade. I made a dress for an Australian bride in 1984. We had three appointments and each time she said the sketches weren't quite right, until she finally said, \"\"You've missed the point. We want our guests to know we've spent an absolute bloody fortune and that this is Australia's royal wedding!\"\". Even three or four years after Diana's fairy-princess dress, wedding gowns were changing to suit the times. This Australian bride wanted the full skirt, but also to be able to detach parts of the dress to reveal her very good figure; there were moves afoot to sex up wedding dresses.\"\" Rob Van Helden, florist \"\"I started my business in 1986. Back then, carnations and chrysanthemums were standard wedding flowers, now they're so unfashionable, as is the way flowers were arranged then – all mixed together in one big vase. People certainly didn't spend money on flowers. Weddings followed a simple routine: ceremony, reception, meal, dancing. The wedding party sat on a long table and the dance floor was in front of them. Now the DJ is flown in from Ibiza and there's a secret nightclub revealed behind a curtain at the back of the marquee.\"\" In the nineties, influenced by a growing culture of conspicuous consumption, weddings became more extravagant and individualised, assisted by changes in the law, in 1995, that meant civil ceremonies could now take place in castles, hotels or stately homes. Meg Matthews \"\"Noel [Gallagher] and I were going to get married on Valentine's Day, 1997, on a barge in Little Venice, but it got leaked to The Sun so we had to cancel it. Noel said, \"\"Leave it to me\"\". We went and had our suits tailored at Daniel James in Savile Row (I had an amazing white suit modelled on the one Bianca Jagger wore to marry Mick, and a hat with a veil). Noel said, \"\"The car is picking us up in the morning. We're going to get married. You can't tell anyone\"\". I remember passing Kate [Moss] on the stairs in the morning – she was living with us at the time – and I was carrying a huge hat box in my arms. I thought it was so obvious, but she didn't clock it. I knew we were going to Las Vegas, but it was still a secret operation. Noel and I flew there via Phoenix. My mum and dad flew via Chicago. Noel's mum, Peggy, came via somewhere else. We all met up at the Liberace suite in Caesar's Palace at midnight, got dressed, then went to the Little Chapel of the West to get married. They played The Beatles, there was a beautiful big cake, flowers – and bottles and bottles of chilled Cristal. Even Walkers crisps. It was about four in the morning by this time, then we all went for steak and eggs and hit the blackjack tables. It was so much fun, just us, our family and Noel's manager and his wife. There was all this rubbish printed about Noel being so drunk he couldn't remember his wedding, but he wasn't even drinking. I drank the Cristal! For our honeymoon, we went to New York. Everyone flew out – Dan Macmillan, Kate, DJ Shadow, we were all in our suite, partying. It wasn't about going away to a tropical island for a week – tradition wasn't in our heads. It was 1997, Oasis were at the peak of their career. It was rock'n'roll!\"\" Kate Halfpenny, bridal designer \"\"There were so many divorces happening in the late Eighties and early Nineties, marriage just wasn't as popular as it had been. Minimalism was in fashion so you had brides like Jemima Khan, in her elegant dress and jacket, or Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy in her simple white sheath dress.\"\" Rob Van Helden \"\"My first huge, huge wedding was that of Prince Pavlos of Greece, in 1995. I had never seen a wedding like it. It went on for four days and there were 1,200 guests. In the Nineties, flowers became a luxury business. The flower world became like the chef world. You had your celebrity chefs and your celebrity floral designers. \"\" Phillipa Lepley, bridal designer \"\"The fabrics got ever more sophisticated in the Nineties. Those slubby silk dupions, or rough taffetas, were out. The look was cleaner, straighter – though brides still wore sleeves, which is not the case now.\"\" The new millennium. After the recession of the late Nineties, a bullish economy was reflected in a rise in the average wedding costs, (from £10k in the 1980s, to £15k today), giving rise to a new wedding industry, worth millions of pounds – an industry which was quick to capitalise on the new laws regarding civil partnerships, passed in 2005, for gay couples, celebrated memorably by the wedding of Sir Elton John to David Furnish. Alice du Parq, Brides Magazine \"\"Martha Stewart launched her magazine in the US in 1994. It took a few years but by the beginning of the Noughties, her influence was being felt in the UK, too. Here was a new way to do weddings – personalised, bespoke, hyper-individualised – which focused on making a visual impression. Couples began to create a continuous theme between the venue, flowers, cake, bridesmaids, cocktail and table décor.\"\" Fiona Leahy, event planner \"\"A lot of upscale, modern weddings are a form of branding – they're a way for a couple to impart and share with guests their personal taste. The first wedding I organised was for Dita Von Teese and Marilyn Manson. Their stamp was on everything. It wasn't all plastic bats and striptease, it was chic, and quite Victorian in style. Couples are far more imaginative now with their weddings – especially since there's no pressure to get married at home. Huge numbers of couples now marry abroad, in France, Italy, Barbados.\"\" Bruce Oldfield \"\"Everything has become more casual in our society, so of course couples want their wedding to be less formal, just as every generation wants less formality than the previous generation. It's an easing up of the rigours – which, in a bride, means not having to have a veil over her face, or wear a tiara. Now a wedding is as much about the ceremony as it is about dancing and having a good time with friends.\"\" Nicky Haslam \"\"People clap in church now when the couple kiss. It's a completely new invention. You never had guests taking cameras into the church, taking pictures of the bride as she walked up the aisle. Nor would you have brides in strapless dresses in the church. Weddings have become more of a public spectacle. They're more a reason for everyone to get pissed. And they go on far too long – some are seven-hour marathons.\"\" Kate Halfpenny \"\"No bride wants that strapless, A-line dress that was so popular five years ago. Very few brides want a corset, either, because there is now this obsession with being comfortable on your wedding day. Veils have become very unpopular, they're seen as too old-fashioned. Which is funny because vintage has been, for the past 10 years, a huge trend in fashion. Some mothers of the bride I see absolutely adore the vintage dresses I make, because they remind them of what they wore themselves on their wedding day. Others hate them for the exact same reason. Although, brides are older now (and some onto their second or third marriages) so their mothers have far less say in what they wear – I've dressed brides for synagogue ceremonies who were definitely showing cleavage.\"\" Alice du Parq \"\"Princess Diana was just 20 when she got married. It's rare for a bride to be that young now – the average bride in the UK is 34. Today's 20-year-old is carving out a career, or finishing university, dating, and figuring out the type of woman she wants to be. She's not thinking about being someone's wife. Most couples live together for years before they decide to marry. It means that wedding lists have changed, too: people already have the kettle and toaster by the time they walk down the aisle. \"\" Tom Konig Oppenheimer, co-owner of PR firm, The Communications Store \"\"When the civil partnership law changed we initially didn't want to get married – Adam and I have been together for 14 years, we didn't feel the need. But then we thought, actually, it's an honour, especially because, for decades, our type couldn't be recognised like that. It was a first for everyone, including us. We'd never been to a gay wedding so we made it up from scratch. We married at Chelsea registry office, then we had 130 for dinner at Tramp's. I was working with Abercrombie & Fitch at the time; I thought, if we're going to be gay, we might as well be really gay, so we got the Abercrombie male models to come and serve vodka, semi-naked. I had recently \"\"won\"\" Thandie Newton at an auction – so she sang after dinner. Simon Sebag Montefiore wrote the evening up for The Spectator (God knows what they thought) and Vogue covered it too – it was the first time they'd featured a gay wedding. It was a lovely, joyous night.\"\" As the decade progressed, celebrity coverage became all-pervasive; couples could now imitate the weddings they saw in glossy magazines. And with the advance of the internet into our lives, couples could now access vast amounts of information – locations, flowers, food, themes – making the choice in how they wed almost infinite. Rob Van Helden \"\"I've done a few footballers' and celebrity weddings that have been covered in Hello!. You have to keep the flowers under sheets to stop the paparazzi at the door from spying. Brides often come to me with pictures of Hollywood weddings – though they don't realise quite how much those American florists charge. With the vast scope of magazines and the internet, there's so much more choice, and brides have become more choosy. It's no coincidence that the term, Bridezilla, has come about.\"\" Fiona Leahy \"\"The internet has made weddings more egalitarian. Unless you were royalty you wouldn't have your own monogram on your wedding invitation. Now, with computer-generated software, you can make your own. It's given couples more freedom to be individual and creative. It follows from the way we live now: we blog, we Tweet. It's all about self-definition.\"\" Weddings became increasingly lavish, until, in 2007, the credit crunch strikes. Rob Van Helden \"\"The build-up of spending power, up till 2007, was incredible. It was all about more, more, more, and, \"\"God, did you go to that wedding where there were 20,000 white roses?\"\". Then we were all brought back down to earth. People have started to believe in the elegance of a wedding, the simplicity. That less is more. It's all about a more relaxed sensibility at weddings now.\"\" Fiona Leahy \"\"At a wedding in the Middle East, I organised, as favours for the guests, mahogany boxes containing individual perfume bottles from Henry Jacques in Paris, worth £500 each. Another occasion, I had to track down albino peacocks for an all-white themed reception. I've had to fly wedding cakes, business class, in their own seats, and send a driver to France to pick up foie gras for a wedding in Scotland. But I'm finding fewer people want to be ostentatious in that way now. People still want to be opulent, but in a less showy manner.\"\" Bruce Oldfield \"\"I opened my shop in Beauchamp Place in late 2009. The first six months were very, very quiet. People were tightening their belts, downscaling their weddings. There was suddenly something vulgar about spending masses of money on a single day.\"\" Vicky Ward, writer \"\"I wrote a book about Lehman Brothers. In August 2008, a senior-level banker at the firm had rented the biggest, most expensive house in St Tropez for his wedding. It was filled with his bride and all their guests, including those he'd flown over from the States at great expense, not least the photographer, Terry Richardson, who was there to take their wedding pictures. But where was the groom? Stuck in New York with a broken leg, and the shit about to hit the fan at Lehman's. No one in that office was going anywhere. In the end he got the red eye over to France, hobbled up the aisle – still wearing the clothes he flew in – saidhis vows, then got straight back on a plane and went home. God only knows how much money was wasted. Lehman's went down on 15 September. Talk about wedding of the moment.\"\" In reaction to the extravagance, and in line with Britain's growing eco-awareness, weddings moved towards more low-key celebrations. Mimicking the bohemian atmosphere of a music festival – or the traditional village fête – country weddings became all the rage. Kate Halfpenny \"\"The press say that I'm making Kate Moss's wedding dress – I'm not. I wouldn't be surprised if she had a quintessentially English wedding, teepees in an apple orchard, fairy lights, but with a rock'n'roll party edge. That kind of English wedding feels more modern than hiring the Dorchester and a sit-down dinner for 150.\"\" On 29 april, Prince William will marry Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey. Vicky Ward \"\"I think it's admirable William and Kate are conscious of austerity Britain, but this wedding is important for the world. No one will replace Diana, but Kate is the fairy tale again. There's no obscure, \"\"Whatever love is\"\", with this couple, they really do seem to be in love. And everyone wants a wedding that reflects that. We're in need of a fairy tale.\"\" Bruce Oldfield \"\"Royal weddings tend to be predictable, and this one will be predictable in so far as there are things that have to be done, in ways that are set. But there will certainly be some surprises. We're making quite a lot of things for the bridal party. People are going for it – hat makers are busy, shoemakers are busy, glove makers are busy. No one does a wedding like the English.\"\" ' \n",
      "Warning! Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'The Saturday interview: Pearl and Daisy Lowe Pearl Lowe spent the mid-90s in a whirl of endless parties that led to addiction and depression. But she and her daughter Daisy are now a major force in fashion, writes Amy Raphael Last September a £35 vintage black polyester dress with a cream lace trim caused the kind of fuss in the fashion world usually reserved for Kate Moss's collections for Topshop. Designed by Pearl Lowe, once a minor Britpop star, the dress sold out in two hours. Peacocks, a budget retailer that managed to be around for over a century without generating much fuss, had to set up a waiting list for the first time in its history. Courtney Love tweeted a message to Lowe asking for a dress to be couriered to her New York hotel. Natalie Imbruglia and Sharleen Spiteri managed to get hold of one. And, after waiting for a few weeks, television presenter Holly Willoughby wore hers on This Morning. Lowe's new collection for Peacocks - a black dress with lace bows, a simple floral dress, a polka-dot dress - was launched this week. Fashion writers blogged and tweeted about the vintage-style dresses for weeks in advance. The collections sell so well because they are easy to wear and hugely flattering, with sleeves and nipped-in waists; they come in sizes 8 to 18 and manage to look unique, like great flea-market finds. The fact Lowe is so well connected helps, too. Before moving to a big house in Somerset with her family - she is married to Supergrass drummer Danny Goffey - she was part of the mid-90s Primrose Hill set that included Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Sienna Miller, Jude Law and Rhys Ifans. It helps, too, that Lowe's daughter Daisy is a supermodel who has modelled her last two Peacocks collections. Daisy is equally well connected: her friend Alexa Chung bought the black polyester dress, and she is a regular on the catwalks of Vivienne Westwood and Chanel shows. Daisy has been modelling since she was signed by Select at 15 and, at 22, is the height of cool. Pearl Lowe reinvented herself a decade ago, when she started designing lace curtains and cushions; since 2006 she has been making handmade dresses, first for Liberty's and then for small London boutiques. She has always been a gifted self-publicist, inviting endless magazines and newspapers into her country house and appearing on the front of Hello! with Daisy when she married Goffey in late 2008. The press, both tabloids and broadsheets, has in turn been infatuated with Pearl for more than a decade. There has been a kind of car-crash fascination with Pearl's endless public discussion of her addiction to cocaine and heroin. Harriet Quick, fashion features director of Vogue, says that \"\"the raw material of Pearl and Daisy's story is not great; it's not as though Pearl married Keith Richards.\"\" But, she adds, \"\"in the last five years, fashion has opened up and it's become easier for people to think, \"\"I can do a line.\"\" We are following on from America, where everyone wants to make a buck out of fashion. And the fact that Pearl also has a \"\"back from hell\"\" story obviously touches people.\"\" When I meet Pearl for lunch at Babington House, a private members' club near her Somerset home, she has been talking for less than 10 minutes before suddenly announcing: \"\"I've been six years sober! Six years!\"\" There's no one around to overhear such a declaration. Perhaps Pearl, 40, is not so much telling the world as herself: as a recovering addict, she needs to keep celebrating her sobriety. She certainly looks great, with those big, generous eyes, a long bob and a dog walker's lithe body. She sips orange juice and texts Daisy, who is in her room with her boyfriend, Matt Smith, taking a nap. Pearl and Daisy are a unique mother-daughter act: Pearl is married to a rock star (albeit the drummer of a band that no longer exists), while Daisy is dating the incumbent Doctor Who, Matt Smith. Yet the reality of their relationship is not cool at all: as Daisy was growing up, Pearl was regularly taking drugs. It defines each of them to a degree; it makes you wonder if Daisy is angry. And yet here she is, drifting through the restaurant in a pretty dress, tights, black boots and a battered, expensive-looking leather jacket. She kisses her mum, hugs her tight and steals her orange juice. When dressed up for fashion shoots, Daisy is often overtly sexual and provocative; today she is virtually free of makeup, and ridiculously beautiful. They chat for a while as though alone. Pearl: \"\"Did you hang out in the bar last night?\"\" Daisy: \"\"No, we had dinner and went to bed. We were supposed to watch the Banksy film and Black Swan and go for a night walk. But we just fell asleep. I woke up at 5.30am and all the lights were on, the curtains were open ...\"\" She gasps. \"\"Ohmigod, we found two frogs in our room, one on top of the other. I think it was a baby frog and a mother frog. They were really cute but we had to pick them up and take them outside. Well, Matt had to.\"\" She catches herself, glances at me: it's clear that Smith is out of bounds. Pearl, oblivious, keeps on chatting. \"\"I'm so happy Daisy isn't like I used to be; I don't just mean not going to the bar last night, but her general lack of interest in big nights out.\"\" Daisy smiles. \"\"I'm always calling mum and saying, \"\"I don't want to go to this party, do I have to go?\"\" Don't get me wrong, I like to have a good party sometimes. But I really like having my friends over, cooking for them, dancing and then doing some painting. It's a really good night in ... \"\" It doesn't sound very rock'n'roll. \"\"If you're talking about drugs, they don't agree with me; I'm too sensitive for them.\"\" It seems that Daisy rebelled against her mum and Danny, whom Pearl met when Daisy was six, by deciding to be resolutely straight. Pearl has three children with Goffey - Alfie, 14; Frankie, 11, and Betty, 5 - and has been sober only since conceiving Betty. NME used to make nasty jokes about her giving birth to Alfie in the toilets of the Dublin Castle pub in Camden. For many years, taking drugs with a host of other north London celebrities was part of Pearl's life. She insists, however, that her kids were oblivious to the drugs. \"\"People used to be round at ours all night and then Danny would start ordering cabs while I opened the windows, lit the Diptyque candles and got the Hoover out. At 6am I'd finally go to bed and then get up and take the kids to school.\"\" I ask Daisy what this was like for her. \"\"I was aware there were lots of cool people in the house. I had no idea mum was doing drugs.\"\" Pearl continues: \"\"When Daisy was 16 she asked me if I'd ever smoked spliff ... \"\" Daisy smiles and pokes at her green minestrone soup. It has been suggested in other interviews that Pearl was often so out of it that Daisy had to look after Alfie and then Frankie, changing their nappies and feeding them. Daisy, laid back until now, sits up straight and almost shouts. \"\"No, no, no. I've always talked about having a strong maternal instinct ... when Mum was pregnant with Alfie, everyone kept saying that I was going to be really jealous of the baby. I took it upon myself to go against what everyone expected and look after him. I would always wake up early - as young kids do - and give him formula, watch Rugrats with him.\"\" Pearl: \"\"Bearing in mind I'd have done the night feeds with him.\"\" Daisy, shrugging: \"\"I was just trying to be a nice daughter.\"\" If this is well-rehearsed PR banter, it doesn't feel like it. Possibly because, as the conversation continues, it becomes clear that it has taken hard work for Pearl and Daisy to be so close. Pearl has always struggled with depression; when Frankie was five she sought help in a clinic. \"\"It wasn't easy. Danny was away on tour with Supergrass so much, and looking after the kids was down to me. I was dreadfully unhappy.\"\" Eventually, she began to realise that she had to leave London, the drugs, the social life, the madness. She found a house to rent in Hampshire and was all set to leave when Daisy, then 15, announced she wasn't coming. \"\"It was the worst period of my entire life,\"\" says Pearl. \"\"I can seriously say that I felt like ending it all. I didn't want to split my family up. I knew that if I stayed in London I wouldn't survive.\"\" Daisy edges first towards her mother and then to the other end of the table, where she spears broccoli as she talks. \"\"But I didn't understand that; I was only 15. I was a pain in the arse, but I didn't want you to go. I didn't want you to leave London. We had to keep talking and talking, but it was ... \"\" She drifts off. \"\"Let's just say there's been a lot of healing since then.\"\" Daisy moved in with her maternal grandmother, got a Saturday job at Agent Provocateur and signed to Select Models. To the outside world it looked as though Daisy's life was charmed. The reality was much more complicated. For years she had wanted to know who her biological dad was; Pearl had assumed it was Bronner Handwerger, a holistic doctor now based in San Diego with whom she had a short relationship. But Daisy worked out that, because of their respective blood groups, he couldn't be. Pearl puts her hand on Daisy's arm and says softly: \"\"In a way I was too scared to find out. I kept thinking it was too late, but it's never too late.\"\" Pearl suspected it might be Gavin Rossdale, a British rock star now living in LA who was once her best friend. \"\"I kept looking at Daisy's eyes and nose and thinking I couldn't live a lie any more.\"\" So, when Daisy was 15, Rossdale took a paternity test and discovered he was her father. Pearl says Rossdale has refused to talk to her since finding out - \"\"I lost a best friend, but found the truth\"\" - while Daisy is in regular contact with him. She looks at her mum. \"\"I hate the fact that you two don't get on. It would make life a lot easier and brighter if you did.\"\" I ask Daisy if she too suffers from depression. \"\"I've definitely got it in me. I'm better than I've ever been. I've given myself a hard time in the past: you've got a lovely family, a great boyfriend, great friends, a great job - it's so out of order for you to feel this way. As soon as I stood up and stared it in the face, I accepted it. It flies away a lot faster.\"\" Out of the window I spot Smith striding up and down the lawn, learning his lines for the next series of Doctor Who. Daisy stares out of the window and smiles. \"\"Aaaah, bless him!\"\" We all three gaze at him for a moment. Daisy pulls herself away first. \"\"Mum and Danny did everything they could for us, sending us to the best schools, making lovely family dinners, letting us have friends round, encouraging us to be open. Granted, my childhood wasn't conventional, but it was full of love. \"\"If ever I'm in trouble I ring my mum. She knows me better than anyone and has great life experience. There is no one else that can fix problems like she does.\"\" In 2007, Pearl wrote a memoir of addiction, All That Glitters, about the years in London that almost killed her. She still grimaces when talking about those hazy years and how she wasn't \"\"the best mother I could be\"\". With anyone else, this might be maddening, but with Pearl the sentiment is so heartfelt it's hard to feel angry, although you do wonder if she will ever be at peace with herself. A little later, I see Pearl, Daisy and Smith huddled together at one end of a bench in the garden. It's the first warm day of the year and there's no reason for them all to be sitting so close together, and they have no idea I can see them. Whatever Pearl may have done wrong, she also did something right. ' \n",

Miniskirts were all about liberation in the beginning, but around their fourth decade they became a tyranny. By 2009, the mini had such a hold over fashion that if you wanted a smart dress that fell knee-length or longer you had to choose between Surrey Housewife Goes to Glyndebourne (shiny, rustly burgundy) or Sunday School Teacher with Body Image Issues (cheap black wool-mix). So then we were all like, excuse me, but we are the net-a-porter generation and we demand longer skirts, there's nothing out there for normal women, bleat bleat. Well, be careful what you wish for, because the calf-length skirt is back, and it turns out that it is not remotely easy to wear, for us norms. In fact, it's hard to wear without looking dowdy. The calf-length skirt looks brilliant on Shoreditch hipsters who get captured looking hung over and sheepishly fabulous on too-cool-for-school blogs. And because these people aren't models, seeing clothes look good on them tricks us into thinking the same clothes will work on us. But this isn't always the case. Luckily, there's a simple test to see if you can pull off ny street-style look. Put on wellies and look in the mirror. If you see louche backstage chic, bingo, you've hit street-style gold. If you look as if you're off to the allotment, it's back to the drawing board. But what the blog-fodder kids wear today, us norms wear tomorrow. So the calf-length skirt will be coming back to your wardrobe. It's called progress. • Jess wears blouse £85, by Jaeger . Skirt £40, by Topshop. Shoes £165, by Russell & Bromley.

The exhibition - curated by Hamish Bowles, European editor at large of Vogue - features 120 haute couture garments, hats and headdresses designed by Cristobal Balenciaga (1895-1972). The collection illustrates Balenciaga's expansive creative vision, which incorporated references to Spanish art - with the iconic 1939 Infanta dress, a modernist interpretation of the dresses worn by the Infanta Margarita in Velazquez's celebrated portraits - bullfighting, dance, regional costume and the pageantry of the royal court and religious ceremonies.

Initial studies also suggest that polyphenols in the syrup may help keep blood sugar levels in check, important for diabetics, by inhibiting enzymes that are involved in the conversion of carbohydrates to sugar, he said. The discoveries of new molecules in the syrup also provide chemists with leads that could prompt synthesis of medications to fight other diseases. The findings were presented this week at an annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Anaheim, California and are to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Functional Foods. The study was funded by the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. A total of 54 beneficial compounds were identified by the researchers in pure maple syrup from Quebec, including five of which have never been seen in nature. Among the new compounds is quebecol - named in honor of the Canadian province of Quebec, which leads the world in maple syrup production. The researchers believe it is created when a farmer boils off the water in maple sap to get maple syrup. It takes 40 liters (20.5 gallons) of sap to make one liter (two pints) of syrup. The sweet sap is collected from maple trees in the spring when freezing and thawing cycles cause it to rise and flow from taps hammered into tree trunks. Seeram said the irony of finding a potential anti-diabetes compound in a sweetener is not lost on him. \"\"Not all sweeteners are created equal,\"\" he said.

It may be in the queue to pay for a top that costs less than a Sunday newspaper, or the moment when you peer into your wardrobe and see 32 pairs of shoes staring blankly back. It may be when you read about pesticides on cotton, or the pennies paid to the women who sew the seams on your jeans. It may simply be the epiphany when you realise that you have enough. Enough stuff, enough already…until the thrill of the new sucks you in again and propels you to the till clutching a silk blouse in a must-have shade of olive green. All the while, though, there’s a lurking discomfort. Recent research shows that we Western women wear most of our clothes only a handful of times and throw before we sew.

Ben Foden kept out of trouble on his return to action after his scrape with the law last weekend as Northampton romped to an eight try victory at Franklin’s Gardens. England full-back Foden, who was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage in London last Monday, might have been hoping for a try by way of atonement. Instead he had to be content with a supporting role, helping create second-half tries for Bruce Reihana and Phil Dowson and making a couple of probing runs. Foden has accepted a police caution and the matter is now closed as far as Northampton director of rugby Jim Mallinder is concerned. “Ben has had an interesting week, but he’s responded magnificently,” he said. “In the first half he was probably trying too hard but in the second half he was magnificent, running strong and hard down the wing. “He’s apologised for what happened and accepted the police caution for his involvement in it and he’s moving on.” Northampton did not need tries from Foden because they were so dominant in the scrum - where Sale’s rookie props Lee Imiolek and Henry Thomas were taught a painful lesson - that they had sealed the bonus point by half-time. But it was only when Sale had hooker Neil Briggs sent off for a second yellow card that Northampton finally converted that superiority into points and a third consecutive league win. Having been sin-binned in the first-half for taking down a maul, Briggs was again in trouble with referee David Rose when he got involved in a fracas that followed Wame Lewaravu’s try. Sale were only five points adrift at that stage and the game was well poised. Having fought their way back into contention through some superb handling and the accurate kicking of Charlie Hodgson, Sale were unable to hold back the Saints tide and leaked 27 points when they were down to 14 men. To compound Sale’s misery, Wales scrum-half Dwayne Peel was carried off on a stretcher early on after he was knocked out. Peel failed to get up when a ruck broke up and play was delayed for ten minutes while he received treatment. His departure marked the start of a torrid six-minute period for Sale in which they conceded two tries and lost Briggs to the sin-bin. Chris Ashton scored his second try in as many games since returning from England duty after Paul Diggin had come off his wing and opened up the home defence. A penalty try from a collapsed scrum completed a quadruple whammy for Sale who showed their resilience by crafting a try for Marc Jones with some sublime handling and kicking. A try from Brian Mujati, after Myler had again kicked to the corner, gave Saints their bonus point after 38 minutes, but the game appeared to be in the balance once more when Sale handled confidently and put Lewaravu in at the corner. Delight soon turned to despair for Sale when Briggs was dismissed and their challenge soon faded. England flanker Tom Wood picked up and drove over for his first try for Northampton, a second penalty try was awarded when Sale illegally repelled another forward surge and Reihana scored with his first touch after Foden gave a sublime pass.

Pippa, 27, who will be Kate’s head bridesmaid, spent three hours locked in designer Alice Temperley’s West London showroom this week. Mother Carole, 56, was on hand, helping to fuel speculation that award-winning Ms Temperley, 36, may design Kate’s dress too. Pippa arrived in her BMW Z4 just minutes ahead of Carole on Thursday afternoon and made no attempt at subterfuge. The Middletons were greeted on the cobbles outside the shop by Ms Temperley, who kissed them on both cheeks. ‘Pippa was in high spirits and very smiley,’ said an onlooker. ‘She was carrying what seemed to be a shoe bag, so possibly any gown being designed isn’t for Kate but a bridesmaid dress for Pippa.’ But Kate, 29, is a fan of trendy Ms Temperley and wore a black and white dress by the designer for her first official engagement with William in December when they attended a charity carol concert in Norfolk. ‘Kate loves Alice’s collections, especially the simplicity of the designs,’ said a source. Ms Temperley has been tipped as Kate’s dress designer, along with Princess Diana’s favourite Bruce Oldfield. But yesterday Ms Temperley’s spokesman said she was unaware that she had been asked to make a dress for Kate or any of her bridal entourage. ‘Not that I know of. It’s nothing I can comment on,’ she said. Buckingham Palace said of Pippa’s fitting with Ms Temperley: ‘It was a private meeting between two individuals.’ Kate is understood to have commissioned two dresses for her big day on April 29. She will change from her Westminster Abbey gown into a second dress for the evening reception Prince Charles is hosting at Buckingham Palace. A friend said: ‘She is loving the fact no one knows who she will wear. Close friends don’t know.’ Sources believe Brazilian Daniella Issa Helayel, whose dress Kate wore when she and William announced the engagement, has not been asked to create anything for the wedding day.’ Bruce Oldfield, 60, refused to comment on whether he was designing Kate’s dress after Pippa and Carole were pictured shopping at his West London shop. But it is widely believed that he is designing an outfit for Carole. Meanwhile, The Mail on Sunday can reveal Kate will have six hairdressers on her big day. Richard Ward and James Pryce, who has been cutting the family’s hair for years, will be joined by four senior stylists at the Goring Hotel in Belgravia. ‘Kate had a practise with a hairdresser on Friday and she’s very happy with how everything is going,’ said a friend.

BERLIN For a look at just how long radioactivity can hang around, consider Germany's wild boars. A quarter century after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union carried a cloud of radiation across Europe, these animals are radioactive enough that people are urged not to eat them. And the mushrooms the pigs dine on aren't fit for consumption either. Germany's experience shows what could await Japan - if the problems at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant get any worse. Nuclear power around the world The German boars roam in forests nearly 950 miles (1,500 kilometers ) from Chernobyl. Yet, the amount ofradioactive cesium-137 within their tissue often registers dozens of times beyond the recommended limit for consumption and thousands of times above normal. \"\"We still feel the consequences of Chernobyl's fallout here,\"\" said Christian Kueppers, a radiation expert at Germany's Institute for Applied Ecology in Freiburg. \"\"The contamination won't go away any time soon - with cesium's half-life being roughly 30 years, theradioactivity will only slightly decrease in the coming years.\"\" Cesium can build up in the body and high levels are thought to be a risk for various other cancers. Still, researchers who studied Chernobyl could not find an increase in cancers that might be linked to cesium. Cesium also accumulates over time in the soil, which makes boars most susceptible They snuffle through forest soil with their snouts and feed on the kinds of mushroom that tend to store radioactivity, Environment Ministry spokesman Thomas Hagbeck said. The problem is so common that now all wild boars bagged by hunters in the affected regions have to be checked for radiation. Government compensation to hunters whose quarry has to be destroyed has added up to €460,000 ($650,000) over the past 12 months, Hagbeck said. \"\"It's really sad when you have to throw out meat that is normally extraordinarily tasty,\"\" said Joachim Reddemann, managing director of Bavaria state's hunting association. Thousands of wild boars killed in southern Germany every year register unacceptable levels of radiation. It's calculated in becquerels, a measurement of radiation given off. Anything beyond 600 becquerels per kilogram isn't recommended, according to Germany's Federal Office for Radiation Protection. Normal meat has an average contamination of 0.5 becquerel per kilogram, and a German would normally consume about 100 becquerels per year from plants and dairy products, the agency said. About 2 percent of the 50,000 boars hunted are above the legal radioactivity limit, Reddemann said. And the government's radiation protection office says some mushrooms have registered up to 20 times the legal cesium limit. Even farther away in France, there is still soil contamination, though levels have dropped significantly. It is now rare to find unsafe levels of cesium in boars and mushrooms, said radiation expert Philippe Renaud of France's Institute of Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety. In Austria, too, traces of radioactive cesium remain in the soil. Along with boars and mushrooms, deer have been affected - some testing at five times the legal limit, that country's environment agency says. Japan's Fukushima plant has so far not leaked nearly as much radiation as Chernobyl, but authorities there have banned the sale of milk, spinach, cabbage and other products from surrounding regions as a precaution. European officials insist that occasionally eating contaminated boar meat or mushrooms does not pose an immediate health risk. Public health agencies are typically conservative in setting limits for radioactivity in food. Eating 200 grams of mushrooms tested seven times above the legal cesium limit, for example, would amount to the same exposure as the altitude radiation taken in during a 2,000-mile flight, according to Germany's Office for Radiation Protection. In Austria, authorities say that eating the unlikely amount of 2 pounds of contaminated boar meat that is 10 times above the legal cesium limit would amount to two-thirds of an adult's normal annual radiation intake by food. However, the possibility of exposure will not be going away anytime soon. \"\"We assume that wild game will still be similarly affected until 2025 and then very slowly recede,\"\" said Reddemann, of Bavaria's hunting association. \"\"The problem will certainly still be around for the next 100 years, and Chernobyl will still be an issue for our children and grandchildren.\"\" Nuclear power around the world ' \n",

Emergency contraception will be given out over the counter as part of an initiative to reduce unplanned pregnancies and abortions. More than 700 community pharmacies will be able to dispense the pill to girls younger than 16 if they believe it is “clinically appropriate”, with parts of Wales having some of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe. The move was announced last year so that women and girls would be able to obtain professional advice and services without appointment, within the 72 hours after sex when emergency contraception is most effective. Steve Simmonds of the National Pharmacy Association said: “The decision in Wales is a clear endorsement of the expertise and unique accessibility of community pharmacy. “Although this service is already offered in Scotland and in many parts of England, we'd like to see it everywhere in the UK free of charge.” The morning-after pill, most commonly Levonelle, is already available free from GP surgeries and sexual health clinics across Britain, and in pharmacies in Scotland and some parts of England. Elsewhere it costs about £25. Outside Wales, pharmacists are not supposed to sell emergency contraception to under-16s other than in “exceptional circumstances” and are meant to refer girls to a GP instead. Some groups have claimed that the decision to allow Welsh pharmacists to hand out the morning-after pill will encourage irresponsible behaviour, or stop young girls receiving important information from doctors. Josephine Quintavalle, the founder of Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said: “It's absolutely the wrong way to address the problems of high rates of teenage pregnancy in Wales. The idea that young girls can just walk into a chemist will mean they become even less responsible about sexuality.” Dr Marina Arulanandam of the Llandaff Surgery in Cardiff told the BBC: “It's important young people know the dangers of unprotected intercourse. “It's not just pregnancy they should worry about, it's Sexually Transmitted Diseases - these are huge problems we need to be addressing and I don't think the pharmacies will have enough time to do this.” A spokesman for the Department of Health said: “Emergency contraception is already free in a range of NHS settings in England but there are no plans to introduce free supply in all pharmacies. Our policy is focused on improving access to more reliable forms of contraception. This has resulted in reducing rates of teenage pregnancies and abortions. “If people under the age of sixteen feel they are ready for sex, they should have the information and advice they need to make responsible choices. Decisions are best made with a healthcare professional, who can discuss the range of contraceptive methods available.” ' \n",

Even now, after 30 surgical attempts to correct the problem, the New Jersey woman can no longer fully close her eyes.

Mary Ellen Kise died at Baptist Health Systems hospital in Prattville, Alabama after receiving a contaminated IV made by Meds IV, LLC. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of her daughter Barbara Young, according to the law firm Beasley, Allen, Crow, Methvin, Portis and Miles. Health authorities confirm that the products - either the fluid or the IV bags containing the fluids - were contaminated with bacteria. But a direct link between the contaminated products and the illness and deaths has yet to be established.

Harold Peterson, 80, of Nashua, sued President Barack Obama and Congress last year objecting mainly to the law's requirement that nearly all Americans carry health insurance. While similar lawsuits have been filed around the country, Peterson's case appears to have been the first brought by a Medicare recipient, according to U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Laplante, who dismissed the lawsuit Wednesday. Laplante acknowledged that the law, and the insurance mandate in particular, \"\"may raise interesting constitutional issues,\"\" but said Peterson had no standing to challenge it because he did not plausibly explain how the mandate would harm him. \"\"As the defendants note, Medicare coverage automatically satisfies the Act's health insurance mandate. So Peterson will not have to incur any financial burdens, or indeed do anything at all, to satisfy the mandate. The federal government will satisfy it for him,\"\" the court wrote. Peterson, who works as a real estate consultant and represented himself in court, said Friday that he disagrees with that reasoning because he believes the law could end up reducing Medicare benefits. \"\"The fact that you have Medicare doesn't make a difference because Medicare is being impacted as well,\"\" he said. The court pointed out that the law expressly states that none of its provisions shall result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits for those covered by Medicare, the government health program for people over age 65. While that doesn't necessarily guarantee the intended results, Peterson's speculation that the law may end up causing benefit reductions wasn't enough to allow the case to continue, the judge wrote. The court also rejected Peterson's claim that the law has caused his supplemental private health insurance premiums to rise. In order for him to sue on those grounds, he would have had to show that a ruling in his favor would have reversed that harm. But since his private insurer wasn't part of the lawsuit, declaring the law unconstitutional would not have ensured that his premiums would go down. Despite the ruling, Peterson said he will continue to highlight what he views as a constitutional crisis. \"\"I decided to file it because I, as well as a lot of other people, are getting tired of the fact that our legislators and other government people are completely ignoring the Constitution,\"\" he said.

But the website Porn Wikileaks has brought a harrowing new level of transparency to Porn Valley by publishing the real names of more than 12,000 porn performers. That's just the start. Porn Wikileaks has wrecked havoc on performers' lives for months by wielding personal information like a weapon. This week we reported that many of the real names posted on Porn Wikileaks were stolen from the patient database of the private clinic that runs STD tests for California's porn industry. The news quickly thrust the site into the spotlight, but the leak has been casting a silent shadow over the industry for months, whispered about on blogs and forums. \"\"Everyone knows it exists but 99% of the blogs and other forums never mention their name,\"\" said porn industry blogger Darrah Ford. \"\"We don't want to give owner publicity.\"\" Porn Wikileaks is not Wikileaks for the porn industry, though they'd like you to believe it. (In fact their mission statement is plagiarized directly from the real Wikileaks' website.) It's more like an online slam book, a repository of facts, gossip and lies deployed strategically to intimidate and punish anyone who crosses the awful hive of homophobic cyberstalkers that run the site. Their weapon is a user-edited wiki of more than 12,000 performers. Most of the entries are just one-line long, with a stage name, real name and date of birth presented via a boilerplate message: So-and-so \"\"is a pornographic whore, and Hooker.\"\" But some entries are astonishingly complete, resembling a guide to aspiring stalkers. Perhaps the most extensive entry belongs to porn star Monica Foster. Foster's entry contains not just details about her career, but a dossier of personal information about her and her family, including addresses and pictures of their homes taken from Google Streetview, as well as the phone numbers for their employers. (\"\"Ivan Mayers gay sex den,\"\" reads the caption next to a picture of her father's apartment.) Foster, who's written a book on how to break into porn, had been an occasional commenter on Porn Wikileaks' forum when she became embroiled in a scandal with baseball star Lenny Dykstra last December. Foster claimed Dykstra gave her a bad check after hiring her as an escort, and she went public with the accusation on her blog. Porn Wikileaks forum members hounded her to post a copy of the check as proof. When she refused, they turned on her, scouring the web for information and filling out her wiki to punish her. Some users changed their avatars to photoshopped pictures of her and her parents. The harassment spilled into the real world. \"\"They called my work, they tried to call my dad's house,\"\" Foster told us. \"\"At this point I was paranoid and afraid that someone might show up at my apartment complex and try to hurt me.\"\" Foster said she's contacted the FBI, but they haven't been able to do much, since the site is hosted in the Netherlands. The identities of everyone involved in Porn Wikileaks is unknown, but it's widely considered to be the brainchild of Donald Carlos Seoane—aka Donny Long. Seone is a failed porn actor and director who was notorious for picking fights in the California porn industry. But he was shut out after he pissed too many people off and is now rumored to be living in Thailand, said talent agent Mark Spiegler. \"\"Nobody would hire him anymore. He tried to be a producer and nobody would deal with him,\"\" Spiegler said. Spiegler remembers one incident a few years ago: After he unknowingly added Seoane's ex-girlfriend to his roster, Seoane called him up and threatened to stuff his neighbor's mailboxes with flyers accusing him of producing child porn. While he fumes in exile, Long is using Porn Wikileaks to take revenge on the industry that spurned him. \"\"He's like a little kid, where if you can't get any kind of good attention you kick somebody in the shins and you get bad attention,\"\" said porn director Lee Roy Myers. When we contacted Long, he denied that he was behind Porn Wikileaks. \"\"I am not a part of PWL other than having an account there and having support from the owners because I was one of the only people to speak out about the gays ruining the porn industry for years,\"\" Long said. Gays ruining the porn industry is a reoccurring theme with Porn Wikileaks. The site constantly rails against crossover stars who work in both gay and straight porn—claiming they are the biggest HIV risks—and its forums are full of homophobic slurs and ranting. Gay porn star James Jamesson was forced to post his negative HIV test result online to counter rumors spread by Porn Wikileaks that he had the disease. Jamesson was worried that someone might believe he was knowingly spreading HIV. \"\"That's dangerous if someone has the right mindset,\"\" he told us. \"\"I can't predict what people are going to do.\"\" In the thread deovted to Jamesson called \"\"All out war on HIV POS James Jamesson u2013 fag will not learn!\"\" one user wrote: How much nigger meatpipe up the shitter is it going to take to make this fag understand he will never be fully accepted in any society. Let them waste their time trying to get this place shut down. That is less time they are fucking someone and possibly increasing the HIV statistics. According to an anonymous Porn Wikileaks administrator, the site is just getting started. \"\"We are getting leaks of 2257\"\"s, model releases and id cards like crazy. We are not ready to release them yet but we think sooner or later everything will be leaked to the public.\"\" Regardless of what you think of the porn industry, terrorizing performers with the threat of extreme privacy violation is wrong. Porn Wikileaks plays directly on fears of HIV and the vulnerability some performers have to being outed to unsuspecting families. The threat of exposure acts as a powerful check on performers who might, say, speak up about an abusive employer, lest links to their parents Facebook profiles show up on Porn Wikileaks.

Symptoms may be similar, but the causes are not FRIDAY, April 1 (HealthDay News) - Colds and allergies can cause similar symptoms, and finding out which condition you have is the first step in getting relief, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI). Colds are caused by one of more than 200 viruses that get transmitted from person to person. Allergies, which are not contagious, are caused by allergens, such as pollen, that prompt the immune system to overreact. In spring, high levels of tree and grass pollens cause sneezing and other cold-like symptoms for the estimated 60 million Americans with allergic rhinitis, more commonly known as hay fever. There are a number of ways to distinguish between spring allergies and a cold, says the ACAAI. Colds generally evolve, starting with a stuffy nose, throat irritation and low-grade fever, followed by sneezing and a runny nose with thickening mucus that often turns yellow or green. Common allergy symptoms include sneezing, itchy eyes and nose, but the mucus is typically clear. While colds usually last a week or two, allergy symptoms persist and can even get worse with continued exposure to the allergen causing your symptoms. Spring allergies can last six weeks or more. Aches and fever most likely indicate a cold, while itchy eyes are strong evidence of allergies. A sore throat and cough can occur with allergies, but most likely suggest a cold. Coughing is common in colds but can also be a sign of allergy-related asthma, especially in children. People with a persistent cough should see an allergist, the ACAAI advises. ' \n",

But now something rather sweeter can be added to the list of healthy foods containing high levels of antioxidants that boost the immune system. Maple syrup is even being described by scientists in America as a ‘one-stop shop’ for beneficial compounds. Tests on the syrup, which is made by boiling sap from the maple tree, found that it contains compounds which could help manage Type 2 diabetes, as well as acting as anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agents. Researchers identified 54 compounds, twice as many as the syrup was previously thought to have. Five were found to be unique to maple syrup. Several of the syrup’s polyphenol, or water-soluble, compounds inhibited the enzymes that convert carbohydrates to sugars, raising the prospect of a new way of managing Type 2 Diabetes. They also found that many of the antioxidant compounds, which prevent the oxidation and ageing of the body’s cells, aren’t found in other natural sweeteners. Dr Navindra Seeram, who led the research at the University of Rhode Island, said: ‘We don’t know yet whether the new compounds contribute to the healthy profile of maple syrup. ‘But we do know that the sheer quantity and variety of identified compounds with documented health benefits qualifies maple syrup as a champion food. ‘It is a one-stop shop for these beneficial compounds, several of which are also found in berries, tea, red wine and flaxseed, just to name a few.’ Explaining the science behind the findings, he said: ‘We found a wide variety of polyphenols in maple syrup. We discovered that the polyphenols in maple syrup inhibit enzymes that are involved in the conversion of carbohydrate to sugar. ‘In fact, in preliminary studies, maple syrup had a greater enzyme-inhibiting effect compared to several other healthy plant foods such as berries.’ ‘By 2050, one in three people will be afflicted with Type 2 diabetes, so finding a potential anti-diabetic compound in maple syrup is interesting for the scientific community and the consumer.’ The findings of Dr Seeram’s team were presented at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in California. Genevihve Biland, marketing director for the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, one of the sponsors of the research, said: ‘Given its amazing potential for human health and great nutritional value, maple syrup is a natural choice for a healthy lifestyle.’ ' \n",

Republican members of a House Ways and Means subcommittee grilled AARP Chief Executive Officer Barry Rand and AARP President Lee Hammond on the nonprofit organization's health insurance operations. Rand defended the group's public policy positions and said money received from insurance licensing agreements was used to fund social-welfare programs for AARP's 37 million members. Republicans argued that the group would gain financially by cutbacks in the law to the Medicare Advantage program that delivers Medicare health benefits through private insurers. \"\"The facts show AARP no longer operates like a seniors' advocacy organization,\"\" said health subcommittee Chairman Wally Herger, a California Republican. \"\"Instead, it more closely resembles a for-profit insurance company.\"\" Herger was referring to a report on AARP finances and operations that he wrote with fellow Republican Representative Dave Reichert and which was released this week. They have asked the Internal Revenue Service to investigate AARP's tax-exempt status as a nonprofit organization. Democrats questioned the motives of Republicans for holding the hearing, saying it was political payback for supporting Obama's healthcare restructuring. \"\"Your sin ... is that you backed the Affordable Care Act,\"\" Democratic Representative Jim McDermott said to Rand. LOSING MONEY Rand challenged the Republican report's findings saying: \"\"We reject the allegation that our public policy positions are influenced by our revenues.\"\" He said that it was more likely the group would lose money under the law, as AARP-branded insurance plans for people between 50 and 64 become obsolete when insurance companies in 2014 can no longer exclude people from coverage because of medical history. The healthcare law also beefs up the Medicare drug benefit for the elderly and limits how much more insurers can charge older people for coverage compared to younger people. UnitedHealth Group Inc. offers supplemental health plans, called medigap plans, using the AARP brand. The plans fill in the coverage gaps left by traditional Medicare. The company also offers a Medicare Advantage plan, which offer more comprehensive coverage, through AARP. Aetna offers AARP-licensed health plans to the 50-64 age group. The Republican report said that Aetna plans represent a small portion of the $657 million in insurance royalties received by AARP in 2009. Sixty-five percent of AARP royalties come from medigap products that stand to gain from the healthcare law, the report said. Reichert said that the report pointed to \"\"a direct conflict of interest between AARP's advocacy for eliminating the Medicare Advantage program ... and the massive profits AARP receives from sponsoring medigap plans.\"\" Rand said the money was used to support AARP's social welfare programs, which include helping older Americans find jobs, providing information on financial security and aiding the hungry. It is not the first time AARP's nonprofit tax status and its insurance affiliations have been questioned. In 1995 then Republican Senator Alan Simpson, who served as co-chairman of Obama's deficit commission last year, probed the organization's business practices. The group came under fire from Democrats in 2003 for its support of the Republican-backed Medicare prescription drug plan. (Reporting by Donna Smith; Editing by Xavier Briand) ' \n",

These declines, seen between 2003 and 2007, continue a trend that began in the 1990s, the researchers added. Importantly, this is the first time a drop in the rate of deaths from lung cancer among women has been seen, coming a decade after lung cancer death rates started declining in men, they noted. \"\"The drop in lung cancer rates among women is due to women quitting smoking,\"\" said report co-author Lynn Ries, a health statistician at the U.S. National Cancer Institute. \"\"Women started smoking a lot later than men, so the peak in the mortality rate occurred a lot later,\"\" she added. The report is the work of researchers at the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society. It is published in the March 31 online edition of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute . Although cancer rates are declining in adults, there has been a rise in cancers diagnosed in children. Most of these involve increases in the incidence of leukemias. However, the rate of death from cancer among children is declining, Ries noted. Ries noted that the reasons for the increase in childhood cancers isn't clear. Among men, the overall cancer rate has remained about the same. In fact, cancer rates in men would have also shown a decline, except for a small rise in the rate of prostate cancer, according to the report. One section of the report focuses specifically on both brain and nervous system cancers and benign tumors. According to the report, benign brain tumors are twice as common as cancerous ones, Ries said. In fact, benign brain tumors account for 75 percent of those in adults and 33 percent of brain tumors in children. \"\"Cancer is not one disease,\"\" Ries said. \"\"The rates for some are going up and some are going down, and there are different patterns for men and for women,\"\" she said. For example: Among men, rates of lung, colon, rectum, oral, pharynx, stomach and brain cancers have dropped. But, rates of kidney, pancreas and liver cancers and melanoma have risen. While, among women, rates of breast, lung, colorectal, uterine, cervical, bladder and oral cancers have dropped. But, rates of kidney, pancreas and thyroid cancers, and leukemias and melanomas, have risen. Racial disparities in cancer still exist, the researchers noted, and the cancer death rate is highest among black men and women, even though the cancer death rate for blacks dropped significantly from 1998 to 2007. In addition, the highest rates of new cancers seen between 2003 and 2007 was among black men. Among women, the highest rate was seen among white women, according to the report. Among both black and white women, breast cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer. These differences may be due to variations in risk behaviors, socioeconomic status and access to and use of screening and treatment, the researchers said. Dr. Joseph Rosenblatt, interim director of the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, attributes declining cancer rates and deaths to a variety of factors. The reduction in the rate of some cancers is mostly due to lifestyle changes, especially people not smoking, he said. On cutting the death rate, Rosenblatt noted that \"\"we have evolved better screening, better diagnostics and better classification of cancers and better treatments,\"\" he said. \"\"We are beginning to see significant decreases.\"\" On the other hand, \"\"we really don't have a good explanation for why childhood cancers have increased,\"\" Rosenblatt said. Most of the rise is in leukemias, and \"\"the good news is that most leukemias are curable in children,\"\" he said. Rosenblatt expects to see even fewer cancer deaths in the future. \"\"The treatments on the horizon are extraordinary,\"\" he said. This change is being brought about by better understandings of how different cancers work and then developing targeted treatments, Rosenblatt said. \"\"The war on cancer has been successful,\"\" he concluded.

But don't expect calorie shock when ordering at the movie theater, where a tub of popcorn can contain well north of a thousand calories - movie theaters are exempt, along with airplanes, bowling alleys and other businesses whose primary business is not to sell food, according to the FDA. Movie theaters pushed to be left out after guidelines published last year included them. The requirements will force chain restaurants with 20 or more locations, along with bakeries, grocery stores, convenience stores and coffee chains, to clearly post the amount of calories in each item on menus, both in restaurants and drive-through lanes. The new rules will also apply to vending machines where calorie information isn't already visible on the package. The calorie counts will apply to an estimated 280,000 establishments and could be on menus by 2012. Required as part of health overhaul legislation signed into law last year, they are designed to give restaurant diners information that has long been available on packaged goods cooked at home. The FDA estimates that a third of calories are consumed by eating out. \"\"We've got a huge obesity problem in this country and it's due in part to excess calorie consumption outside the home,\"\" says Mike Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods. \"\"Consumers generally when you ask them say they would prefer to have that information.\"\" The FDA said it will take feedback on the proposed rules before finalizing them, probably by the end of this year. In addition to movie theaters, alcohol will also be exempted, and Margo Wootan, of the nutrition policy at the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, says the latter could be misleading to consumers. \"\"I think it's going to be confusing if customers see the calories for soft drinks and juice labeled on the menu but not other drinks such as beer and wine. It will make it seem like they are better choices.\"\" Still, Wootan says the guidelines are a positive step. \"\"You won't have to get out of line and go back to some poster by the bathroom and look at some item in a tiny font size.\"\" The idea is to make sure that customers process the calorie information as they are figuring out what to eat. Many restaurants currently post nutritional information in a hallway, on a hamburger wrapper or on their website. The new law will make calories immediately available for most items.

On the other hand, a good many men might receive false-positive results and overtreatment, adding an element of risk to widescale screening, the researchers report in the March 31 online issue of the BMJ . \"\"In the light of our findings, I would say that the benefit from screening is not sufficient to support mass screening,\"\" said study author Dr. Gabriel Sandblom, an associate professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. \"\"However,\"\" added Sandblom, \"\"the study was initiated more than 20 years ago, when PSA [prostate specific antigen testing] was not available and the treatment of localized prostate cancer was not as effective as it is today. I would thus not categorically advise against PSA testing based on an individual decision from a man who feels concern about prostate cancer.\"\" This advice is not out of line with recently updated guidelines on prostate cancer screening from the U.S. government. The recommendations, issued in 2008, take a dim view of prostate cancer screenings at any age for healthy men and flatly recommend against them entirely for men over 75. The American Cancer Society has also recently revisited the issue of prostate cancer screening. \"\"A little over a year ago, the American Cancer Society revised its guidelines, which reinforced the message that men need to be informed that there are known benefits, but also limits, to PSA screenings,\"\" said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate and colon cancer at the American Cancer Society. \"\"The American Cancer Society does not encourage nor discourage prostate cancer screenings.\"\" This new study does carry with it several significant weaknesses, Brooks added. In particular, because of the timing and design of the study, most men really only received one and, at most, two PSA tests. \"\"At best, this is a study of one or two PSA tests in men in their late 50s and early 60s,\"\" he said. For the study, researchers looked at all men in the Swedish city of Norrkoping who were between the ages of 50 and 69 in 1987, a total of 9,026 men. Of these, 1,494 men were screened for prostate cancer - first with a digital rectal exam (DRE) and, starting in 1993, with both DRE and PSA tests - every three years. In 1996, only men aged 69 or under were screened. The remaining 7,532 men did not undergo screening and served as a comparison group. The mortality rate for men who underwent screening was not significantly different from that in the control group, although tumors in the screened group tended to be smaller and more localized. Commenting on the study, Dr. Chad LaGrange, an assistant professor of urology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, said he believes the findings actually add \"\"much more uncertainty\"\" to an already complex problem. With more and more studies on the subject, \"\"guidelines have become vague recommendations,\"\" he said. \"\"We don't really have any good rules anymore.\"\" The bottom line: \"\"It's not just as simple as PSA screening either works or it doesn't. Patients should talk about it with their doctor,\"\" LaGrange said. \"\"PSA testing shouldn't be just a reflex anymore.\"\" But the good news hidden here is that the number of prostate cancer deaths continues to decline, whether it be better screening or better treatment, he said. \"\"We're doing something right,\"\" LaGrange stated.

Democrats in the Senate, which ended its workweek Thursday, remained resistant to both the deeper cuts demanded by House members as well as the scores of amendments seeking to make policy changes by reining in environmental regulations, financing for family planning groups and plans to carry out the health care overhaul. Though both parties oppose passing any more short-term spending plans, the threat of a government shutdown continued to loom, something President Obama, speaking at a shipping facility in Landover, Md., implored lawmakers to avoid. “It would be the height of irresponsibility to halt our economic momentum because of the same old Washington politics,” he said. “The American people don’t want us to go to our respective corners and have the same battles we’ve been having for decades.” Speaker John A. Boehner reiterated that Republicans also wanted to avoid a politically and financially costly shutdown. “If you shut the government down, it’ll end up costing more than you’ll save because you interrupt contracts,” he said at a news conference Friday. “There are a lot of problems with the idea of shutting the government down. It is not the goal.” Staff members of the Appropriations Committees in both the House and the Senate were expected to work through the weekend to figure out how to spread roughly $33 billion in cuts across government agencies. Lawmakers on both sides of the Rotunda and from both parties have informally agreed on that number as a target for reducing spending for the rest of this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Yet in the House it remains unclear whether the more conservative members, especially the 87 Republican freshmen, would accept that figure. In the Senate, which Democrats control, it is uncertain if lawmakers would agree to deeper spending cuts, as well as rollbacks of some environmental regulations and other amendments. “We announced the other night in our meeting with the vice president that the White House nor Senate leaders are going to accept any E.P.A. riders,” Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said in a conference call with reporters Friday. With the weekend on the horizon, the House spent Friday afternoon serving up partisan warfare, with a side order of mockery. Republicans narrowly passed a bill that called for their 2011 spending bill — one that already failed in the Senate — to become law should the Senate fail to approve its own spending measure by April 6. The vote was 221 to 202, with no Democrats in support and 15 Republicans against it. At one point, Representative Anthony Weiner, Democrat of New York, read aloud on the House floor from “House Mouse, Senate Mouse,” a children’s book sold in the Congressional gift shops. The story explains how a bill becomes a law — a process that requires both Senate and House “mice” to back a measure, “ ‘And if enough do, if enough do, this president signs it if he likes to,’ ” read Mr. Weiner, before accurately noting that the “Senate mice” had yet to pass the spending bill approved by the House. Because the measure to bypass the Senate would itself require Senate approval, a highly unlikely outcome, Friday’s vote was largely meaningless. But it did allow Republicans to make the point that the Senate has yet to pass its own spending bill. ' \n",

Secretary-General's 2011 Report on AIDS highlights new strategies in the fight against the disease and urges universal access to treatment, care and support for those infected with the virus, and an end to discrimination against them.

But despite the overall decline, the number of infected people is increasing in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, North Africa and the Middle East and parts of Asia. \"\"No country has escaped the devastation of this truly global epidemic,\"\" the report said in a summary of the 30 years since AIDS emerged as a major health challenge across the world.

Marie-Soleil Beaudoin, a doctoral student at the University of Guelph in Ontario, with Professors Lindsay Robinson and Terry Graham, discovered not only that a healthy person's blood-sugar level spikes after eating a high-fat meal, and it doubles if caffeinated coffee is added - jumping to levels similar to those of people at risk for diabetes. In the study, healthy men drank about 1 gram of a fat-laden beverage - a fat cocktail that contains only lipids - for every kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. Six hours later, they were given a sugar drink. When people eat sugar, the body produces insulin, which takes the sugar out of the blood and distributes it to our muscles, Beaudoin explains. The study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, found that the fatty meal affected the body's ability to clear the sugar out of the blood - blood-sugar levels were 32 percent higher than they were when the men had not ingested the fat cocktail. However, after they received two cups of caffeinated coffee 5 hours after ingesting the fat beverage and later a sugar drink - blood-sugar levels increased by 65 percent. ' \n",

While the change of heart has come late for the two unfortunate souls who have already passed away as a result of the budget cut, at least those who remain alive would now have a chance to survive. That's some pretty good news - if only it were true. Contrary to yesterday’s happy reports, Governor Brewer has done nothing to restore this funding. What she did do was send a letter to HHS Secretary Sibelius wherein she offered a rather intriguing trade. If the Secretary would agree to Brewer's desire to cut some $500 million from the state's Medicaid program, Governor Brewer would reciprocate by restoring the $1.2 million in funding for the transplant program. Brewer's proposal would eliminate all new enrollments for Arizona adults who do not have children, along with ending the availability of Medicaid services to those who earn 75% of the federal poverty level or more. To be clear, that's not 75% above the poverty level. Brewer seeks to cut off Medicaid services to those who earn 25% below the federal poverty line. The result of the governor's plan would be the denial of Medicaid to approximately 160,000 Arizonans. And, if it's all good with the HHS Secretary, Governor Brewer would also like to increase payments for approximately 200,000 Arizonans who wish to stay on Medicare. Some deal, right? All Sibelius has to do is allow Brewer to completely cut off vital medical services to some 160,000 Arizonans while raising the costs of care for 200,000 more who would struggle to pay the extra charge and, in return, the governor will reciprocate by giving up her 100 hostages waiting to die due to lack of money to pay for the transplants that would save their lives. What a gal. As luck would have it, that $500 million figure Brewer seeks to cut from state Medicaid services fits snuggly into a rather gaping hole in the Arizona state budget -the one created when Governor Brewer pushed through a $538 million corporate tax cut package earlier this year But what's a governor to do? Finding an extra $1.2 million to save 100 lives is no easy chore. Never mind that the Governor found $5 million to give to the Pinal County Sheriff for an immigration-enforcement fund that his own county supervisors refused to provide. Never mind that Brewer spent $1.7 million of the stimulus money given her by the federal government to fix the roof of Veterans Memorial Coliseum - money that could have legally been spent on the transplant program. But a governor's got to do what a governor's got to do. And if 100 people have to die so that Pinal County can track down one more illegal alien, then I suppose that's just the price and privilege of being an Arizonan. ' \n",

The advisers' 8-6 vote came in response to concerns, especially from parents, that the commonly used dyes might be linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in some children. The advisory panel made its recommendation based on the FDA's evaluation of existing data, as well as testimony from researchers. It was the lack of rigorous studies, as well as a lack of data, that prompted the panel to ask for more research into the issue and delay a recommendation on artificial food colorings, CNN reported. The issue pitted the food industry against some parents, public watchdog groups and academics who've long agitated for a closer look at the additives. The FDA advisers, concluding two days of hearings that featured parents, scientists and food-industry representatives, said there wasn't enough evidence to definitively say that food dyes contribute to ADHD. The FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory panels, but it usually does so. Artificial dyes are added to many foods including JELL-O, Lucky Charms, Pop-Tarts, Nestles Butterfinger bars, Hostess Twinkies and Frito-Lay Doritos, to name a few, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The FDA does have regulatory authority over food additives. For example, in 1976, Red No. 2 was banned because it might be cancer-causing. This week's meeting was significant because it was \"\"the first time the FDA has acknowledged that food dyes may affect children in a limited way,\"\" said Dr. David Schab, a psychiatric researcher and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center and the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City. Schab, who was scheduled to testify at the hearing, called it \"\"a big step forward.\"\" The question the panel was dealing with was whether the dyes cause ADHD, or might they simply trigger some nonspecific behaviors, such as irritability and insomnia, Schab said. Jeff Cronin, a spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which has long lobbied for a ban on the dyes, said \"\"the evidence that artificial food dyes worsen some children's behavior is pretty convincing.\"\" Cronin had hoped that the FDA panel would recommend warning labels on foods with these additives, and encourage companies to switch to safer colorings. Given the studies done so far, Schab said he also favored eliminating artificial colorings from foods. \"\"I would like the FDA to eliminate dyes, but I would also be very happy if we would have a label warning, like the ones that protect Europeans,\"\" Schab added. \"\"Labels that warn that these dyes have potential detrimental effects on behavior.\"\" Based on its review of published studies, the FDA at this point said \"\"a causal relationship between exposure to color additives and hyperactivity in children in the general population has not been established.\"\" However, it did go on to say that for some children with ADHD and other behavioral problems, these dyes may exacerbate their problems. But dyes may not be the only food additive that has this effect, the FDA noted. On the other side of the debate, Brian Kennedy, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, contended that \"\"the safety of artificial colors has been affirmed through extensive review by the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority, and neither agency sees the need to change current policy.\"\" Kennedy added that \"\"all of the major safety bodies globally have reviewed the available science and have determined that there is no demonstrable link between artificial food colors and hyperactivity among children.\"\" Another industry voice said that food aesthetics matter to American consumers. In a statement, David Schmidt, president and CEO of the International Food Information Council, said that \"\"food colors add to our enjoyment of food by maintaining or improving their appearance.\"\" \"\"Without sufficient scientific evidence that a causal link truly exists between food colors and hyperactivity in children, communications that suggest a link could have unintended consequences, including unnecessarily frightening consumers about safe ingredients that are consumed every day,\"\" he said. \"\"Misguided theories dilute the impact of advice from health professionals on methods that have been found through scientific research to be truly effective in treating ADHD, such as medication and behavior modification.\"\" However, Dr. Roberto F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, believes the dyes could have neurological effects on children. \"\"The European Food Safety Authority has made it law that foods that contain these additives have a warning label,\"\" he said. \"\"This is already old news in the Old World.\"\" Lopez-Alberola said these dyes make foods more attractive, especially to children, and he speculates that part of the increase in ADHD and autism has resulted from food additives. \"\"It's not the sugar, it could well be these colorants,\"\" he said. Cronin, the spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said there are alternatives to chemical colorings. He said that when warning labels were put on foods in Europe, it caused many U.S.-based food companies to market natural-based food-colored products in Europe. More information ' \n",

Even though the Food and Drug Administration is instituting new calorie-labeling requirements for food, movie theaters will be exempt. A tub of butter-laden popcorn can contain well above 1,000 calories. Along with movie emporiums, exemptions have been made for airplanes, bowling alleys and other businesses whose primary business is not to sell food , according to the FDA. Movie theaters pushed to be exempted after guidelines published last year included them. The FDA is imposing new requirements that will force chain restaurants with 20 or more locations, along with bakeries, grocery stores, convenience stores and coffee chains, to clearly post the number of calories in each food item. The rules will also apply to vending machines. The calorie counts will apply to an estimated 280,000 establishments. ' \n",

They stressed that the radioactive materials found in grass clippings from upstate Will County and in Springfield air samples are in minuscule amounts, far below established safety levels. \"\"These levels are very low and present no hazard to people in Illinois,\"\" Jonathon Monken, director of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, said in a statement. \"\"We will continue to track the deposition of radiation in Illinois to ensure there is no impact on public health and safety.\"\" Agency spokeswoman Patti Thompson said officials are now testing grass in Madison and Clinton counties and milk from local cows in Clinton and Bond counties, with additional testing in West Chicago and the Springfield area. The Metro East counties were chosen because of their proximity to the agency's Springfield facilities and the fact that they're not near any of Illinois' six operational nuclear facilities. In Missouri, officials of the state's Department of Health and Senior Services regularly monitor air, water and local milk, at monitoring sites in St. Louis, Jefferson City and Springfield. \"\"We have not received any reports of elevated radiation,\"\" said department spokeswoman Jacqueline Lapine. At least 15 other U.S. states have found trace levels of radioactivity apparently resulting from releases half a world away, at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power reactors. The reactors were severely damaged in the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and resulting tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, sparking worldwide concern about radioactivity. Thompson describes the radioactive levels found so far in Illinois as being about 200,000 times lower than the regulatory limits set for nuclear power plants. \"\"It was almost impossible to detect,\"\" she said. The intent with continued testing \"\"is to let people know we're watching for it ... and to make sure we don't see levels later that are of concern.\"\" Thompson said there is little doubt the readings are from the Japan disaster. \"\"This is a material that you really only find from a fission process, and this is the only thing we know of in the world with that kind of release.\"\" The material in question has an eight-day \"\"half life,\"\" meaning it loses half its radioactivity in eight days, and in effect will be gone in seven weeks.

A necropsy of the four-year-old bear who died suddenly two weeks ago showed he was suffering from encephalitis, an irritation and swelling of the brain that was likely brought on by an infection, pathologist Claudia Szentiks said. It remains unclear what that infection was, but Achim Gruber, a professor of veterinary medicine at Berlin's Free University, said it likely was a virus. Knut, who was born at the zoo, quickly rose to celebrity status as an irresistibly cute cub who had been rejected by his mother. Knut died March 19 in front of hundreds of visitors, turning around several times and then falling into the water in his enclosure. Experts who examined Knut found large quantities of fluid in his lungs, supporting the conclusion that the immediate cause of death was drowning. But they said that even if he hadn't fallen into the water he likely wouldn't have survived. - AP Suicide bomber kills 3 in Fallujah BAGHDAD - A suicide bomber disguised as a street cleaner walked up to soldiers outside a mosque and blew himself up Friday, killing two of the troops and a worshiper in a western Iraqi city that was once an al-Qaeda in Iraq hotbed.

The sharp reduction to $690 per dose came two days after the Food and Drug Administration publicly invited competition. The drug, a synthetic form of progesterone commonly called 17P and marketed under the trade name Makena, is recommended for women at high risk of delivering prematurely. The drug is administered via injection weekly for about 20 weeks. Friday's announcement by K-V Pharmaceutical Co. of a 55 percent price reduction puts the list cost of a full course of treatment at $13,800. That's down from $30,000 under K-V's old price but still a sharp jump from the $400 a woman could expect to spend if she had the drug made at a compounding pharmacy. Until this year, an FDA-approved version of 17P was not available. So the only alternative for women was to take a prescription for the drug to a compounding pharmacy that produced individual batches of it for $10 to $20 a dose. In February, the FDA granted K-V Pharmaceutical Co. exclusive rights to make Makena for seven years. K-V subsequently priced it at $1,500 a dose and sent letters warning compounding pharmacies of an FDA crackdown if they did not stop making their versions. The FDA reacted Wednesday, saying it wasn't planning on blocking compounding pharmacies from making the drug, essentially encouraging patients to go that route. K-V defended its pricing as justified by development costs. But the FDA noted K-V relied on a study by the National Institutes of Health to demonstrate the drug's effectiveness. ' \n",

Initial studies also suggest that polyphenols in the syrup may help keep blood sugar levels in check, important for diabetics, by inhibiting enzymes that are involved in the conversion of carbohydrates to sugar, he said. The discoveries of new molecules in the syrup also provide chemists with leads that could prompt synthesis of medications to fight other diseases. The findings were presented this week at an annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Anaheim, California and are to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Functional Foods. The study was funded by the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. A total of 54 beneficial compounds were identified by the researchers in pure maple syrup from Quebec, including five of which have never been seen in nature. Among the new compounds is quebecol - named in honor of the Canadian province of Quebec, which leads the world in maple syrup production. The researchers believe it is created when a farmer boils off the water in maple sap to get maple syrup. It takes 40 liters (20.5 gallons) of sap to make one liter (two pints) of syrup. The sweet sap is collected from maple trees in the spring when freezing and thawing cycles cause it to rise and flow from taps hammered into tree trunks. Seeram said the irony of finding a potential anti-diabetes compound in a sweetener is not lost on him. \"\"Not all sweeteners are created equal,\"\" he said.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Federal Plan Would Streamline Medicare Emphasis Shifts From Hospital Visits to Preventative Medicine Health and Human Services proposed new regulations Thursday it hopes will reduce Medicare costs and improve care by focusing funds on prevention and quality, rather than the number of times a patient sees a doctor. Affordable care organizations could save Medicare $960 million over the next three years, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said. She emphasized the need for preventive care, saying that 1 in 5 Medicare patients who make a visit to the hospital are back within 30 days, and that 1 in 7 suffer a harmful mistake. An additional 100,000 patients die from infections every year. \"\"These results are unacceptable,\"\" she said. Under the proposed system, which would begin in 2012, hospitals and other medical facilities serving more than 5,000 Medicare patients could form teams of primary care doctors, nurse practitioners and specialists to coordinate a patient's care. The patient would still be able to choose his own doctor, and the system is voluntary. The regulation comes as part of the federal health care law, but is open for public comment before it is finalized later this year. Half of Medicare beneficiaries have more than one chronic condition and often receive care from several doctors, according to Health and Human Services. If doctors don't talk to each other, they can make mistakes in prescribing medications that shouldn't be taken with the patient's other prescriptions, or could administer care or tests the patient has already received. \"\"It describes what we've been up to for 10 years,\"\" said Steve Safyer, president of Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. \"\"It really is what people are moving toward.\"\" Safyer said coordinated care emphasizes quality and safety, and at his hospital, it means going out to visit elderly patients who live in four-story walk-ups in the Bronx, or making sure patients can get all of their care in one place. One doctor takes charge of each patient's care, while a team nurse coordinates appointments. The care manager makes sure a patient knows what to avoid with his heart-disease medications, as well as calling to ensure a diabetic patient has her blood sugar under control. \"\"From a financial point of view, 80% of our payments are Medicare and Medicaid,\"\" he said. \"\"This is the only system, in my mind, that can manage the expense.\"\" The organizations would be eligible for bonuses if they improve the quality of their care and reduce wasteful practices. But there's some risk: The government will create a benchmark that each organization must reach to assess whether it will receive a bonus from the savings created, or repay shared losses. Mike Nugent, co-author of \"\"Accountable Care Organizations: Your Guide to Strategy, Design, and Implementation,\"\" said there are at least 50 affordable care organization projects being considered across the country. A small number do it because of the shared-savings aspect of the plan, he said, but more do it because they need to cut costs. \"\"The bigger issue is that [Medicare] reimbursement is not going to increase as it has in the past,\"\" he said. In the past, Medicare payments have increased about 3% every year, but now those payments will be capped, and doctors will have to cut costs to keep their services competitive. \"\"Competition preempts reform. Competition preempts these regulations.\"\" ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Concierge medicine fills a niche, but its spread could worsen shortage of frontline doctors WASHINGTON - Every year, thousands of people make a deal with their doctor: I'll pay you a fixed annual fee, whether or not I need your services, and in return you'll see me the day I call, remember who I am and what ails me, and give me your undivided attention. But this arrangement potentially poses a big threat to Medicare and to the new world of medical care envisioned under President Barack Obama's health overhaul. The spread of \"\"concierge medicine,\"\" where doctors limit their practice to patients who pay a fee of about $1,500 a year, could drive a wedge among the insured. Eventually, people unable to afford the retainer might find themselves stuck on a lower tier, facing less time with doctors and longer waits. Medicare recipients, who account for a big share of patients in doctors' offices, are the most vulnerable. The program's financial troubles are causing doctors to reassess their participation. But the impact could be broader because primary care doctors are in short supply and the health law will bring in more than 30 million newly insured patients. If concierge medicine goes beyond just a thriving niche, it could lead to a kind of insurance caste system. \"\"What we are looking at is the prospect of a more explicitly tiered system where people with money have a different kind of insurance relationship than most of the middle class, and where Medicare is no longer as universal as we would like it to be,\"\" said John Rother, policy director for AARP. Concierge doctors say they're not out to exclude anyone, but are trying to recapture the personal connection shredded by modern medicine. Instead of juggling 2,000 or more patients, they can concentrate on a few hundred, stressing prevention and acting as advocates with specialists and hospitals. \"\"I don't have to be looking at patient mix and how many are booked per hour,\"\" said Dr. Lewis Weiner, a primary care physician in Providence, R.I., who's been in a concierge practice since 2005. \"\"I get to know the individual,\"\" Weiner said. \"\"I see their color. I see their moods. I pick up changes in their lives, new stressors that I would not have found as easily before. It's been a very positive shift.\"\" Making the switch can also be economically rewarding. If 500 patients pay $1,500 apiece, that's gross revenue of $750,000 for the practice. Many concierge doctors also bill Medicare and private insurance for services not covered by their retainer. Patients and family members say the fee is worth it. Linda Popkin lives in New York, far from her 97-year-old mother in Florida. With their mother in a concierge practice, Popkin says she and her siblings have direct access to the doctor as needed. \"\"If one of us calls the doctor, he calls us back,\"\" she said. \"\"We are involved in all the decisions. We definitely have peace of mind that Mom is seeing a doctor she can speak to if we have any questions. I'm sure you've heard the horror stories about people calling the doctor and they can't get in for three weeks.\"\" Popkin's mother didn't lose her Medicare. She's still covered for medications, specialist visits, hospitalizations and other services. But she has an additional level of personalized attention. Her doctor is affiliated with a Florida-based management company called MDVIP, a wholly owned subsidiary of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble that represents the largest group of concierge physicians in the country. MDVIP marketing executive Mark Murrison says its doctors do not sell access, but a level of clinical services above what Medicare or private insurance cover. The cornerstone is an intensive annual physical focused on prevention. About half the patients are Medicare beneficiaries. Retainer fees range from $1,500 to $1,800 a year, and MDVIP collects $500 of that for legal, regulatory and other support services. Murrison said the fee is affordable for middle-class households when compared with the cost of many consumer goods and services. \"\"One of our goals is to democratize concierge medicine,\"\" he said. For now, there may be fewer than 2,000 doctors in all types of retainer practice nationally. Most are primary care physicians, a sliver of the estimated 300,000 generalists. The trend caught the eye of MedPAC, a commission created by Congress that advises lawmakers on Medicare and watches for problems with access. It hired consultants to investigate. Their report, delivered last fall, found listings for 756 concierge doctors nationally, a five-fold increase from the number identified in a 2005 survey by the Government Accountability Office. The transcript of a meeting last September at which the report was discussed reveals concerns among commission members that Medicare beneficiaries could face sharply reduced access if the trend accelerates. \"\"My worst fear — and I don't know how realistic it is — is that this is a harbinger of our approaching a tipping point,\"\" said MedPAC chairman Glenn Hackbarth, noting that \"\"there's too much money\"\" for doctors to pass up. Hackbarth continued: \"\"The nightmare I have — and, again, I don't know how realistic it is — is that a couple of these things come together, and you could have a quite dramatic erosion in access in a very short time.\"\" Another commissioner at the meeting, Robert Berenson, called concierge medicine a \"\"canary in the coal mine.\"\" Several members said it appears to be fulfilling a central goal of Obama's overhaul, enhancing the role of primary care and restoring the doctor-patient relationship. Yet the approach envisioned under the law is different from the one-on-one attention in concierge medicine.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'High-end medical option prompts Medicare worries High-end medical option prompts Medicare worries (AP) WASHINGTON (AP) — Every year, thousands of people make a deal with their doctor: I'll pay you a fixed annual fee, whether or not I need your services, and in return you'll see me the day I call, remember who I am and what ails me, and give me your undivided attention. But this arrangement potentially poses a big threat to Medicare and to the new world of medical care envisioned under President Barack Obama's health overhaul. The spread of \"\"concierge medicine,\"\" where doctors limit their practice to patients who pay a fee of about $1,500 a year, could drive a wedge among the insured. Eventually, people unable to afford the retainer might find themselves stuck on a lower tier, facing less time with doctors and longer waits. Medicare recipients, who account for a big share of patients in doctors' offices, are the most vulnerable. The program's financial troubles are causing doctors to reassess their participation. But the impact could be broader because primary care doctors are in short supply and the health law will bring in more than 30 million newly insured patients. If concierge medicine goes beyond just a thriving niche, it could lead to a kind of insurance caste system. \"\"What we are looking at is the prospect of a more explicitly tiered system where people with money have a different kind of insurance relationship than most of the middle class, and where Medicare is no longer as universal as we would like it to be,\"\" said John Rother, policy director for AARP. Concierge doctors say they're not out to exclude anyone, but are trying to recapture the personal connection shredded by modern medicine. Instead of juggling 2,000 or more patients, they can concentrate on a few hundred, stressing prevention and acting as advocates with specialists and hospitals. \"\"I don't have to be looking at patient mix and how many are booked per hour,\"\" said Dr. Lewis Weiner, a primary care physician in Providence, R.I., who's been in a concierge practice since 2005. \"\"I get to know the individual,\"\" Weiner said. \"\"I see their color. I see their moods. I pick up changes in their lives, new stressors that I would not have found as easily before. It's been a very positive shift.\"\" Making the switch can also be economically rewarding. If 500 patients pay $1,500 apiece, that's gross revenue of $750,000 for the practice. Many concierge doctors also bill Medicare and private insurance for services not covered by their retainer. Patients and family members say the fee is worth it. Linda Popkin lives in New York, far from her 97-year-old mother in Florida. With their mother in a concierge practice, Popkin says she and her siblings have direct access to the doctor as needed. \"\"If one of us calls the doctor, he calls us back,\"\" she said. \"\"We are involved in all the decisions. We definitely have peace of mind that Mom is seeing a doctor she can speak to if we have any questions. I'm sure you've heard the horror stories about people calling the doctor and they can't get in for three weeks.\"\" Popkin's mother didn't lose her Medicare. She's still covered for medications, specialist visits, hospitalizations and other services. But she has an additional level of personalized attention. Her doctor is affiliated with a Florida-based management company called MDVIP, a wholly owned subsidiary of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble that represents the largest group of concierge physicians in the country. MDVIP marketing executive Mark Murrison says its doctors do not sell access, but a level of clinical services above what Medicare or private insurance cover. The cornerstone is an intensive annual physical focused on prevention. About half the patients are Medicare beneficiaries. Retainer fees range from $1,500 to $1,800 a year, and MDVIP collects $500 of that for legal, regulatory and other support services. Murrison said the fee is affordable for middle-class households when compared with the cost of many consumer goods and services. \"\"One of our goals is to democratize concierge medicine,\"\" he said. For now, there may be fewer than 2,000 doctors in all types of retainer practice nationally. Most are primary care physicians, a sliver of the estimated 300,000 generalists. The trend caught the eye of MedPAC, a commission created by Congress that advises lawmakers on Medicare and watches for problems with access. It hired consultants to investigate. Their report, delivered last fall, found listings for 756 concierge doctors nationally, a five-fold increase from the number identified in a 2005 survey by the Government Accountability Office. The transcript of a meeting last September at which the report was discussed reveals concerns among commission members that Medicare beneficiaries could face sharply reduced access if the trend accelerates. \"\"My worst fear — and I don't know how realistic it is — is that this is a harbinger of our approaching a tipping point,\"\" said MedPAC chairman Glenn Hackbarth, noting that \"\"there's too much money\"\" for doctors to pass up. Hackbarth continued: \"\"The nightmare I have — and, again, I don't know how realistic it is — is that a couple of these things come together, and you could have a quite dramatic erosion in access in a very short time.\"\" Another commissioner at the meeting, Robert Berenson, called concierge medicine a \"\"canary in the coal mine.\"\" Several members said it appears to be fulfilling a central goal of Obama's overhaul, enhancing the role of primary care and restoring the doctor-patient relationship. Yet the approach envisioned under the law is different from the one-on-one attention in concierge medicine. It calls for a team strategy where the doctor is helped by nurses and physician assistants, who handle much of the contact with patients. John Goodman, a conservative health policy expert, predicts the health care law will drive more patients to try concierge medicine. \"\"Seniors who can pay for it will go outside the system,\"\" he said. MedPAC's Hackbarth declined to be interviewed.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'FDA proposes calorie counts on menus WASHINGTON • Like it or not, many restaurant diners will soon know more about what they are eating under menu labeling requirements proposed Friday by the Food and Drug Administration. The requirements will force chain restaurants with 20 or more locations, along with bakeries, grocery stores, convenience stores and coffee chains, to clearly post the amount of calories in each item on menus, both in restaurants and drive-through lanes. The new rules will also apply to vending machines where calorie information isn't already visible on the package. The calorie counts will apply to an estimated 280,000 establishments and could be on menus by 2012. Required as part of health overhaul legislation signed into law last year, they are designed to give restaurant diners information that has long been available on packaged goods cooked at home. The FDA estimates that a third of calories are consumed by eating out. \"\"We've got a huge obesity problem in this country and its due in part to excess calorie consumption outside the home,\"\" says Mike Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods. \"\"Consumers generally when you ask them say they would prefer to have that information.\"\" But don't expect calorie shock when ordering at the movie theater, where a tub of popcorn can contain well north of a thousand calories - movie theaters are exempt, along with airplanes, bowling alleys and other businesses whose primary business is not to sell food, according to the FDA. Movie theaters pushed to be left out after guidelines published last year included them. Alcohol will also be exempted, according to the agency. Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest, says that could be misleading to consumers. \"\"I think it's going to be confusing if customers see the calories for soft drinks and juice labeled on the menu but not other drinks such as beer and wine,\"\" she said. \"\"It will make it seem like they are better choices.\"\" Still, Wootan says the guidelines are a positive step.

Many restaurants currently post nutritional information in a hallway, on a hamburger wrapper or on their website. The new law will make calories immediately available for most items. Menus and menu boards will also tell diners that a 2,000-calorie diet is used as the basis for general nutrition advice, noting that individual calorie needs may vary. The labeling requirements were added to the health bill with the support of the restaurant industry, which is facing a smattering of different laws from cities and states. New York City was the first in the country to put a calorie posting law in place. Since then, California, Seattle and other places have done so. Dawn Sweeney, president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association, said the calorie postings will provide customers with consistent information. \"\"The new standard,\"\" she said, \"\"will help chain restaurants provide the same type of nutrition information to consumers in any part of the country.\"\" Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Some fast-food chains in the state, including McDonald's and Starbucks, have already begun displaying calorie counts on posted menus in some locations.

The small study was the first to examine the benefits of yoga on atrial fibrillation - a problem that is a leading cause of stroke and is most common in the elderly. In addition to halving the episodes of atrial fibrillation, the study found that yoga also reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression related to the condition. \"\"These findings are important because many of the current conventional treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation include invasive procedures or medications with undesirable side effects,\"\" said Dr. Dhanunjaya Lakkireddy, an associate professor with the University of Kansas Hospital in Kansas City, Kansas, who led the study. He presented his findings at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology being held in New Orleans. The study involved 49 patients with the heart rhythm disorder who had no physical limitations and no prior experience with yoga. Their episodes of irregular heartbeat were measured for a six-month period by researchers at the hospital. During the first three months, patients were allowed to participate in any physical activity they liked. For the remaining three months, they underwent a supervised yoga program that involved breathing exercises, yoga postures, meditation and relaxation. Forty-five minute yoga sessions with a certified professional were held three times each week, and patients were encouraged to practice daily yoga exercises at home. Heart monitors measured episodes of irregular heartbeat throughout the trial, and patients completed short self-administered surveys to assess their levels of anxiety, depression and overall quality of life. \"\"SIGNIFICANT IMPACT\"\" On average, yoga cut episodes of the irregular heartbeat in half, while also significantly reducing depression and anxiety scores and improving scores in physical functioning, general health, vitality, social functioning and mental health, the researchers found. \"\"It appears yoga has a significant impact on helping to regulate patients' heartbeat and improves the overall quality of life,\"\" Lakkireddy said. Atrial fibrillation causes blood to pool in the upper chambers of the heart, where it can clot and travel to the brain, causing strokes. Millions of patients with the condition take the blood thinner warfarin every day to lower the risk of such clots, and thereby prevent strokes. Considering its low cost and benefits, Lakkireddy said yoga should be considered in overall treatment of atrial fibrillation and other heart rhythm problems. But Lakkireddy cautioned that larger studies are needed to bear out the findings of his study, and that patients should continue with standard medical therapy. \"\"Based on my findings, one should not tell patients that yoga will fix everything and they can stop taking their anticoagulants. Yoga is strictly a supplement for everything else they are doing medically,\"\" he said. A new wave of promising medicines to prevent such strokes is being developed by several drugmakers, one of which - Xarelto being developed by Bayer (BAYGn.DE: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) - will be highlighted at the heart meeting. But the pills come with side effects, and are expected to cost thousands of dollars a year, when they reach the market. (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot) ' \n",

In the 2010 mid-term elections, the GOP successfully garnered the vote of the nation's seniors by a 21% margin. Not bad, considering that this demographic is one of the most reliable groups of voters in any national, state or local election. While the elderly have gravitated to the Republican Party for some time now, the fear the GOP has been sewing within this community over the Medicare cuts coming from Obamacare was all it really took to deliver these very healthy voter margins around the country – never mind that the Republicans achieved this success by mischaracterizing the Medicare cuts at every opportunity in the effort to frighten the nation's seniors. Yet, for reasons that boggle the rational mind, seniors have now become a target of both the GOP budgeting process and the House Ways And Means Committee. First, the budget. It is no great surprise that House GOP budget maven, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisconsin), is expected to announce the GOP plan to cut $1 trillion in Medicaid over the next ten years. While these cuts will bring devastating consequences to the nation's poor and disabled, protecting the needs of the poor has never been a priority with the GOP. What does surprise is that Ryan has indicated that he intends to additionally propose some large cuts in Medicare - although he is being somewhat cagey about letting on just how large those cuts will be. While the expectation is that Ryan will suggest a voucher system whereby seniors will be given government checks to use in purchasing their medical care -checks that remain static or rise via cost of living adjustments despite the fact that medical costs tend to increase at a rate well in excess of the cost of living- we’ll all have to wait and see as the Congressman is not giving away many details. Of course, who can blame Ryan for being vague on the Medicare cut numbers as the nation's senior citizens -and the AARP - are not likely to take the news very well. Still, knowing what is coming, it seems reasonable to wonder what is to become of our senior citizens when these voucher checks no longer cover the costs of serious illness. As noted, opponents of health care reform never miss an opportunity to remind our seniors that the ACA legislated away some $500 billion in Medicare money. However, these cuts were largely the result of ending the 11% premium the government has been paying to Medicare Advantage programs for the identical services provided to Medicare beneficiaries when paid for directly from the government program. This premium charge was not an accident. When the Medicare Advantage program was created – in the effort to move the administration of Medicare to the private sector – the insurance companies asked the government to subsidize their efforts until they could get their respective programs up on their feet. They also promised that they would have these programs running efficiently by 2010 when the subsidy was scheduled to come to an end. Thus, the largest chunk of cuts in the Medicare budget resulting from the ACA comes from ending the corporate subsidy that was already scheduled to end in 2010. As a result, none of these cuts legislated in the ACA mean any loss of important medical care to our elderly. How the Republicans’ plan to cut further into Medicare without obliterating essential health care benefits should be an interesting exercise and one that could send seniors running back to the Democratic Party in droves - and the Republicans know it. Which is why the GOP has chosen this moment to seek to discredit the AARP, the primary lobby for the nation’s elderly. This week, when the Ways and Means Committee released its report, \"\"Behind the Veil: The AARP America Doesn't Know,\"\" Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Charles Boustany (R-La.) suggested that the senior citizen lobby's commercial activities interfere with its tax-exempt status, and he called for an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service to determine whether the group's \"\"privileged status ought to be revoked.\"\" Via Politico The report pulls no punches when arguing that AARP is a primary beneficiary of Obamacare in that the end of Medicare Advantage programs (and the overcharges to the taxpayers that comes with them) will result in an increase in the supplemental Medicare policies that AARP endorses. Republicans argue that AARP supported a provision in the overhaul that cut $200 billion from the Medicare Advantage program because the group will benefit when seniors replace their coverage with supplemental Medicare policies — known as “Medigap” policies — that the group endorses. Via California Healthline Sour grapes, anybody? So intent is the GOP in punishing AARP for its support of health care reform that they now seek to pull the organization's tax-exempt status as payback – virtually guaranteeing some nasty blowback from the key, senior voting demographic. If this isn't a messaging opportunity that even Democrats can't screw up, I don’t know what is. Welcome back, senior citizens of America! It was only a matter of time until those who have pretended to care about your well being managed to reveal themselves and show you who really has your back. ' \n",

The House passed H.R. 1255, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act, in the face of mockery and derision from both sides of the aisle, The Hill reported. The act would make the House-passed fiscal year 2011 spending bill, which included $61 billion in cuts to the federal budget, law if the Senate fails to pass its own legislation by April 6. But Democrats mocked the GOP effort, saying it displayed a shocking lack of understanding for how the U.S. government and its Constitution work. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., offered Republicans a copy of a children's book titled, \"\"How our Laws are Made,\"\" while Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., brought a copy of \"\"House Mouse, Senate Mouse\"\" to the House floor to illustrate the process of how a bill becomes a law in this country. \"\"What you see on the floor today is no example of Democracy in action,\"\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said. \"\"It's silly.

This is not real, America.\"\" Disbelief was not limited to the Democrats, however, as the bill passed by a vote of 221-202 - including 15 \"\"no's\"\" from Republicans. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, took the floor to say the bill \"\"violates my conscious and the Constitution, and I cannot vote for it.\"\" Republicans argued the bill was meant to highlight Senate inaction. \"\"What we're trying to do with this resolution today is get our business done,\"\" said Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Ga., the Los Angeles Times reported. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said a shutdown \"\"looms ever larger\"\" because of the Senate's failure to pass a bill.

Most media outlets took the April Fool’s day opportunity to post a few gag stories that — well, sometimes — seemed remotely plausible. It was sometimes tough to figure out the real stories from the jokes. What’s even funnier is that some of the stories that might as well have been jokes turned out to be the real. Here’s a list of the top stories from today (and a few others) that the VentureBeat staff has agreed should have been just an April Fools’ Day prank. A corporate development employee at Facebook was terminated for purchasing shares of Facebook on secondary trading markets. Michael Brown was fired from Facebook after purchasing shares on a secondary market, which the company considers insider trading. TechCrunch reported that the trading was related to a deal in which Facebook raised $500 million from Goldman Sachs. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt tried to hide his political contributions from Google Search. Schmidt asked the Google Search team to remove information about a political donation from the Google Search results, according to BusinessInsider. The information came to light in journalist Stephen Levy’s new book, “In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works and Shapes Our Lives.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg might have signed off on a $5 billion deal in a Mexican restaurant in Palo Alto. A patron of Palo Alto Sol on California Avenue told VentureBeat that Zuckerberg sat at a table in the back of the restaurant with one other man and appeared to be signing papers Tuesday. At one point, Zuckerberg was overheard saying, “So we’ll do it at $5 billion?” Microsoft files an antitrust complaint against search giant Google. Oh, how the tables have turned. Microsoft and other companies claim that Google has undermined its competition when it comes to search, its Android mobile software, and online advertising. In particular, Microsoft says that Google prevents other search engines from fully indexing information from its services like YouTube. Social photo app Color raises $41 million in its first round of funding from Sequoia Capital. Okay, so there’s a lot of money and an all-star team. What does the app actually do? The goal was to create a social experience that’s “native” to mobile and really takes advantage of smartphone technology rather than simply transferring a Web-based experience to the phone. That’s worth $41 million. Tags: april fools’ day, wtf Copyright 2011 VentureBeat. All Rights Reserved. VentureBeat is an independent technology blog. Read More \"\" ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Quotes of the day “Tim Pawlenty is making a list of potential running mates. “Asked for his top five vice presidential picks, Pawlenty didn't hesitate in naming Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez.” *** “It’s difficult at this point to try to determine who has the best chance to be the Republican candidate in the 2012 election. Still, it’s fair to say that Tim Pawlenty could pursue a potentially successful ‘Goldilocks Strategy’ for the nomination… “[I]t would be very difficult to win merely by mobilizing the ‘very conservative’ party base. Mathematically speaking, it is possible, but in practice multiple candidates tend to be in competition for that bloc, which means the ultimate winner will probably have to string together a voting coalition that samples from the more moderate factions. There are, of course, many ways to skin this cat — and George W. Bush’s coalition in 2000 was more conservative than McCain’s in 2008 — but the point is that, whichever mix you put together, Pawlenty, or any other candidate, will need some kind of mix. And it would be very difficult to win the nomination without getting at least 15 percent of either the ‘very conservative’ or the ‘moderate’ faction. “In other words, candidates who can pursue a ‘Goldilocks strategy’ can be favored — those who come across as not too conservative or too moderate, but fall somewhere in between. And on this front, Pawlenty might be able to carve out a real niche for himself.” *** “Over the course of the last five months PPP has polled Republican voters in 16 different states that had primaries or caucuses while Romney was still in the race for President in 2008. Comparing the support Romney received then to the support he has now does not present a pretty picture for his chances at winning the nomination. On average he is doing 14 points worse than he did in his first campaign. These numbers suggest that little of the support he received in 2008 was ‘hard’ and that with a different field of candidates he could have difficulty getting the same people who voted for him the first time around to do it again… “I don’t know whether these declining numbers for Romney are because voters have actually turned against him over the last three years or because he was more of a default choice they weren’t terribly enthused about in the first place, but they certainly show he hasn’t been making a whole lot of new friends since his last bid.” *** “I see three [factors], and all have to be in place and reinforce each other for Obama to lose. First, the economy in 2012 has to be either stagnant or in decline in the 10 or so key electoral states (especially the ones in the Midwest) as he heads into the election. This would mean that the economy is creating very few net jobs in 2012 and that prices (including food and gas) are still rising. “Second, no new major international crisis arises that causes people to rally behind Obama because of his competent handling of it. And I emphasize the words ‘new,’ ‘major,’ and ‘competent.’ Afghanistan and Iraq devolving again into a problem will not help Obama, and actually may hurt him because our country has basically moved on from the situation in both places. “Third, a Republican nominee has to emerge who is charismatic; is a very good communicator; is in touch with the country's economic and social needs; and is a new brand of GOP leader whom many younger voters can connect with. Think of what it took in 1980 to defeat the Democratic incumbent - Ronald Reagan and crises galore.” *** “‘I think what the younger voters have figured out is that this is a broken relationship. He made soaring promises and grand expectations. He's broken those promises,’ [Pawlenty] told the crowd of students. ‘If this was a Lady Gaga song, the relationship between the youth vote and Barack Obama would be \"\"Bad Romance.” “Pawlenty, Minnesota's most recent former governor and a potential future presidential hopeful, said the news of the day has been dominated by the tragedy in Japan, issues in the Middle East, and Charlie Sheen. “‘We may not in this room have tiger blood like he does,’ Pawlenty said, referring to the television actor, ‘but we've got something else in common with him. There's going to be a lot of winning on the Republican side in 2012.’” *** “Pawlenty is viewed by many GOP Insiders as the 2012 contender with the least political baggage who has positioned himself as a candidate with the broadest appeal to the party conservative base from tea party supporters to values voters. ‘Increasingly the choice by process-of-elimination,’ noted one Republican Insider. ‘His strategy is to be the least offensive of the ugly girls still standing at the bar at 2 a.m.,’ joked another GOP Insider.” ' \n",

Marsha Barbour told WLOX, a Mississippi television station, that the idea 'horrifies' her. It's not her husband's less-than-stellar chances of winning that scare her. No, it's the time commitment that running would require. \"\"Why am I afraid? It's been a lot to be the first lady of the state of Mississippi,\"\" she said, \"\"and this would be 50 times bigger.\"\" She also estimates that a Barbour Administration would require ten years of their life, though she might be getting a little ahead of herself. Regardless of how understandable her concerns may be, this won't help her husband's chances any, which some already viewed as dubious. In addition to his wife's trepidation about him running for the nation's highest office, the NAACP also accused Barbour of pushing for a civil rights museum for purely political gain. \"\"This is a media attention-grabber to launch his presidential race,\"\" Derrick Johnson, the organization's president, told Salon. But considering that he lauded a segregationist group as recently as December and “Haley Barbour racist” is the second Google auto-suggestion when you type in the governor's name, rehabilitating his reputation on race issues might be a good move. Barbour's not even the most popular Republican in his home state. A poll conducted by Public Policy Polling showed that Mike Huckabee would do better against President Obama in Mississippi, winning by 14 points instead of Barbour's 10-point margin. His wife is afraid he'll run for president, the NAACP called his efforts to build a civil rights museum purely political, and he's not even the most popular Republican in his home state; all in all, not the best end of the week for Mr. Barbour.

The move was revealed by William Hague in another emergency statement on the military action to the Commons this afternoon. The Foreign Secretary told MPs the five included the military attache as he updated the House on yesterday's summit in the capital. His statement came after David Cameron said during PMQs that Britain had not ruled out providing arms to rebels in the country. British warplanes have now flown more than 160 missions over Libya as they police the no-fly zone enforced against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. More than 350 planes from 15 nations have been committed to the effort, with vessels from 10 countries supporting the arms embargo. Mr Hague said: \"\"The situation on the ground remains fluid. Regime forces have intensified their attacks, driving back opposition forces from ground they had taken in recent days. \"\"Misrata also came under heavy attack yesterday, with further loss of civilian life, including children, from mortars, sniper fire and attacks on all sides from regime tanks and personnel carriers. \"\"One obstacle to humanitarian support for the people of Misrata has been regime vessels trying to blockade the port. These vessels were attacked by coalition aircraft yesterday. Four of them were sunk and one vessel was beached.\"\" It was confirmed that a British diplomatic mission, headed by UK ambassador to Italy Christopher Prentice, visited Benghazi on Monday and Tuesday to meet opposition groups including the INC and its military council. Mr Hague said: \"\"The London conference showed that we are united in our aims - seeking a Libya that does not pose a threat to its own citizens or to the region and in working with the people of Libya as they choose their own way forward to a peaceful and stable future. \"\"And it demonstrated that clear international support for the people of Libya. With that support there is every prospect of focused and sustained assistance to the people of Libya as they seek to determine their own future.\"\" Earlier, Mr Cameron said the UN resolution permitting action in Libya \"\"would not necessarily rule out\"\" arming rebels fighting Gaddafi. The PM was asked by Labour leader Ed Miliband whether the terms of the resolution 1973 override the arms embargo imposed by the earlier resolution 1970. He replied: \"\"I have said before in the House that we must do everything to comply with both the Security Council resolutions. \"\"The arms embargo applies to the whole of the territory of Libya, but at the same time UN Security Council resolution 1973 allows all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas. \"\"Our view is that this would not necessarily rule out the provision of assistance to those protecting civilians in certain circumstances. We do not rule it out but we have not taken the decision to do so.\"\" Former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell warned that \"\"extreme caution\"\" must be taken on the issue. Mr Cameron said any decision to supply arms would have to be considered with \"\"due care\"\" as there were some \"\"very strong arguments\"\" on both sides. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in London for the summit, suggested yesterday that it would be legal to arm the rebels. \"\"It is our interpretation that 1973 amended or overrode the absolute prohibition on arms to anyone in Libya, so that there could be a legitimate transfer of arms if a country should choose to do that,\"\" she said. Meanwhile, Italian foreign minister Franco Frattini confirmed that Rome was in discreet contact with a number of countries over the possibility of Gaddafi going into exile overseas. \"\"I hope there will be a certain number of states ready to host him - maybe under the auspices of the African Union, which can have leverage over them,\"\" he said. He \"\"categorically\"\" ruled out Italy offering Gaddafi a bolt-hole. Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: \"\"We have got a clear view, which is that he should go. We also think people should be held accountable for their actions. \"\"We are not engaged in looking for somewhere for him to go, but that doesn't exclude others doing so. Our priority is that he should go as soon as possible. \"\"I don't think exile necessarily precludes someone being held accountable by the ICC.\"\" Mr Hague, asked last night about the possibility of exile, said: \"\"That is up to him. There is no doubt that if Colonel Gaddafi left power - wherever he went - there would be a major change in the situation, and that is what most of the world, and probably most of the Libyan people, want to see.\"\" ' \n",

The complicated issue of Ethiopian Jewish heritage and eligibility for aliya came to the fore again on Wednesday morning as thousands of demonstrators clashed with police outside the Israeli Embassy in Addis Ababa, local media there reported. \"\"I can confirm that about 80 people were injured in the demonstrations, four were taken to hospital and all but one person, who is serious condition, has been sent home,\"\" Asher Seyum, the Jewish Agency for Israel representative in Ethiopia, told The Jerusalem Post. While the majority of reports from the scene described the demonstrators as \"\"Ethiopian Jews\"\" and said they were \"\"demanding that the Israeli Government consider their applications to travel to their homeland to rejoin their families,\"\" Seyum and other Ethiopian Jewish sources denied that this community is actually Jewish. \"\"They live illegally in a former Jewish Agency compound near the Israeli Embassy and they claim that they have Jewish roots,\"\" explained Seyum, adding \"\"most of them have been checked for eligibility by the State of Israel and most of them have been turned down for aliya but they refuse to give up.\"\" In an interview in the Africa Review, one young demonstrator described how police had \"\"tore up an Israeli flag and desecrated our synagogue.\"\" Even though this specific group does not fit the criteria to make aliya under guidelines originally laid out by the Israeli government in 2003 and approved again last November, it still chooses to follow Jewish tradition and religious practices. Many of the men wear kippot and the group prays daily in a makeshift synagogue. According to Ethiopian Knesset Member Shlomo Molla, a vocal advocate for continuing eligibility checks for one specific group of Ethiopians that claims Jewish ancestry (referred to as Falash Mura), the Israeli government working with the Jewish Agency closed its compound in Addis Ababa six years ago after completing background checks of some 10,000 Falash Mura. \"\"Roughly 2000 people did not meet the criteria and were turned down for aliya,\"\" he explained, adding that among the community in Gondar a further 3000 were also not approved to immigrate to Israel. Both Molla and Seyum said they believed that those are the people who often protest outside the Israeli embassy for the right to move to Israel. \"\"The problem is that if you widen the criteria then there will be no end to the aliya from Ethiopia,\"\" said Seyum, adding \"\"I have worked out that from one person who is accepted for aliya you could trace another 60 people who might be able to argue that they have the right to come too.\"\" The issue of Ethiopian Jewish aliya has become particularly controversial in recent years with the government backtracking regularly on its position regarding the Falash Mura Jews. There have also been fierce debates among the Ethiopian community in Israel over who should be allowed to move to the Jewish state and who should not. Four years ago, the government announced plans to wind up its aliya operation in Ethiopia and by the start of 2008 the Interior Ministry had recalled its Gondar-based staff. However, subsequent protests from local community members, representatives of North American Jewry and several key Israeli legislators insisted that up to 9000 Falash Mura still needed to be assed for immigration according to a 2003 resolution that was based on a national census - the Efrati list - compiled by then Interior Ministry Director General David Efrati in 1999. To be eligible, aliya applicants must appear on this list, have relatives to sponsor them living in Israel and be able to trace their maternal lineage back seven years to Jewish roots. In September 2009, the Interior Ministry announced that its representatives would be returning to Ethiopia to continue eligibility checks but less than a year later the matter came under doubt again when the treasury claimed the process was too costly. Further pressure from the pro-Falash Mura lobby, soon reversed this decision and last November, the cabinet finally gave approval for eligibility checks to be carried out on 8700 people with a view to ending the organized aliya for good. At the core of the debate over this complicated African immigration story is the government's willingness to recognize the 1999 Efrati list, which originally included three volumes: Falash Mura living in Addis Ababa, those in Gondar and others from outlying villages. Interior Ministry officials at the time decided to focus only on those from the two cities, ignoring the list from the villages. However, as people left the cities, more Falash Mura Jews arrived from the villages and those are the people who today are waiting in Gondar to immigrate to Israel. \"\"It is important to wrap up this issue as fast as possible,\"\" MK Molla said Wednesday. \"\"The longer we wait the larger these groups claiming Jewish heritage will grow and then this story will never end.\"\" Jewish Agency spokesman Haviv Rettig Gur told The Post that even though organized aliya from Ethiopia will soon be over \"\"Any Jew and any aliya eligible person can make aliya, including from Ethiopia.\"\" \"\"What is changing is that the special aliya track that goes beyond the regular aliya absorption package is ending,\"\" he said, adding \"\"If Jews remain in Ethiopia they'll still be able to make aliya. Those deemed ineligible for either track are not eligible for aliya.\"\" Gil Shefler contributed to this report. ' \n",

The long-term Green dream is to shift from power-sharing with Labor in government to supplanting the ALP. Julia Gillard, after entering a formal alliance with the Greens to form a minority government, has realised, in the wake of the NSW electoral disaster for Labor, that the Greens are a threat to her short-term credibility and long-term political appeal. After relying on written undertakings with the Greens and rural independent MPs to form a government last year, the Prime Minister has become increasingly alert to the need to frame herself as a conservative, middle-road Australian than she is perceived to be. At the same time, she is distancing herself from the Greens, who find themselves facing real media scrutiny for the first time. Gillard has been putting herself in the middle and setting Labor against the \"\"extremes\"\" of the Coalition and the Greens. The Labor leader and some of her ministers have started using strident language to condemn the Greens' policies and paint them as being unworldly and not a party of government. At the same time, the Greens' leader has been pushing his party as mainstream, reasonable and responsible as he tries to pick up Labor voters and any Liberals who want action on climate change.

April 1 (Bloomberg) - Ivory Coast forces backing election winner Alassane Ouattara said they seized the state broadcaster and attacked incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo’s residence and presidential palace amid heavy fighting. The Republican Forces now control Gbagbo’s residence in the Cocody neighborhood of Abidjan, the commercial capital, said Meite Sindou, a spokesman for Ouattara’s prime minister, Guillaume Soro. Explosions and gunfire continued to rock the district and plumes of smoke rose into the sky, residents said. Gbagbo’s spokesman denied speculation he fled the country. “He is on Ivoirian territory, he has no intention of resigning,” the spokesman, Ahoua Don Mello, said in an interview broadcast today on Radio France Internationale. The Republican Forces entered Abidjan late yesterday after an ultimatum for Gbagbo to accept his Nov. 28 election defeat and step down lapsed. The fighters had swept south from their base in the north of the country over the past two weeks, meeting little resistance from Gbagbo’s forces. “Radio Television Ivorienne fell into our hands last night,” Sindou said in a phone interview today. Television broadcasts were halted at about midnight as heavy artillery fire and explosions shook buildings. Abandoned Cocoa prices have tumbled 9.4 percent in the past 10 days as traders predict an imminent end to the impasse in the world’s largest cocoa producer. The crisis led the West African nation to default on its $2.3 billion Eurobond, which has rallied 38 percent in 10 days as Ouattara’s forces advance. The United Nations, the U.S., the African Union and the European Union all recognize Ouattara, 69, as the winner of the nation’s first vote in a decade, while Gbagbo, 65, refuses to step down, alleging voter fraud. Gbagbo’s whereabouts are unknown, Bernard Valero, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of former colonial power France, told reporters in Paris today. “The security forces around Mr. Gbagbo seem to have abandoned him, after he’d been abandoned by the army leadership,” Valero said. “This creates uncertainty and risk in the town, particularly for looting.” Desertions An elite 1,000-member security unit founded by Gbagbo in 2005 announced today it would defect to Ouattara’s government. The unit, known as the Centre de Commandement des Operations de Securite, or Cecos, called on its members to “rally without further delay to the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast,” according to a statement on its website. Even before the Republican Forces entered Abidjan, the head of Gbagbo’s army, General Phillipe Mangou, sought refuge at the residence of the South African ambassador, the Pretoria-based Foreign Ministry said. In another blow to Gbagbo, General Edouard Tiape Kassarate, head of the military police, defected to Ouattara’s administration at its headquarters in the Golf Hotel in Abidjan, Alain Lobognon, an adviser to Soro, said in a telephone interview yesterday. “I’m not sure Gbagbo is in control any longer,” said Rinaldo Depagne, a Dakar-based analyst for International Crisis Group. “The first step for a peaceful outcome is Gbagbo coming and saying ‘I quit’.” Human Rights There was a “mass exodus” out of Abidjan as civilians tried to avoid the clashes, the UN Refugee Agency said on its website yesterday. The UN said it had received “unconfirmed but worrying reports” of human rights violations committed by the Republican Forces in the western towns of Guiglo and Daloa and in Abidjan. The fighters may have arbitrarily arrested, abducted and extorted money from civilians, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in an e-mailed statement. Pro-Gbagbo troops have committed “daily” human rights violations, including the reported burning of two civilians alive, OCHA said. Ouattara yesterday ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew and the closure of all borders, according to an e-mailed statement.

Death Toll At least 494 people have died in the conflict so far, the UN said in an e-mailed statement. Retreating Liberian mercenaries committed arbitrary executions and looted towns, especially around the western town of Guiglo, it said. About 500 foreign nationals had taken refuge at a French military camp on the outskirts of Abidjan, Agence France-Presse reported, citing Colonel Thierry Burkhard of the French army. A 34-year-old Swedish woman working for the UN mission in Ivory Coast was killed by gunfire in her home in Abidjan last night, Carl Bildt, Sweden’s foreign minister, said in an e-mailed statement today.

There is a real sense of lawlessness.” African Union Commission President Jean Ping called on Gbagbo to “immediately” step down and hand power to Ouattara, according to an e-mailed statement today. Gbagbo still has “an opportunity to step aside and avoid bloodshed,” Johnnie Carson, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, told reporters in Washington yesterday. If he doesn’t he will be held accountable for violence in the city, Carson said. - With assistance from Franz Wild in Johannesburg, Jason McLure in Accra, Gregory Viscusi in Paris and Gopal Ratnam in Washington.

Alassane Ouattara, who won November's UN-supervised election, also ordered the country's borders closed in an attempt to prevent strongman Laurent Gbagbo and his allies from fleeing. Residents of Abidjan locked up in their homes reported barrages of heavy arms fire punctuated by detonations throughout the night. On the peninsula where the presidential palace is situated, buildings were shaking with each explosion, witnesses said. Patrick Achi, a spokesman for Mr Ouattara, said the fighters had breached the city limit overnight and were waging battles at the palace and the residence. Mr Achi said the forces, who are former rebels who fought in a civil war a decade ago that left Ivory Coast divided, had seized Radio Television Ivoirienne, the government-owned broadcaster. Choi Young-jin, the top United Nations envoy in Ivory Coast, told French radio on Thursday that as many as 50,000 soldiers, police and members of the security force have abandoned Mr Gbagbo in recent days. Sanctions imposed on Mr Gabagbo and his inner circle failed to dislodge the strongman, but analysts say the armed offensive will force the regime out within days. \"\"It's over – except for the shooting,\"\" said a diplomat stationed in the city. A Swedish woman working for the United Nations was killed by a stray bullet during the fighting in Abidjan on Thursday night, the Foreign Ministry in Stockholm confirmed.

Researchers measured a suite of factors - blood sugar, blood fats, blood pressure, waist size, and body mass - that when elevated add up to \"\"metabolic syndrome,\"\" and found that vegetarians were lower than non-vegetarians on all counts except cholesterol. Having metabolic syndrome puts people at a greater risk of developing diabetes or heart disease in the future. In the study, 23 out of every 100 vegetarians were found to have at least three metabolic syndrome factors, compared with thirty-nine out of every 100 non-vegetarians and 37 out of every 100 semi-vegetarians. \"\"I was expecting there should be a difference,\"\" said Nico Rizzo of Loma Linda University, the lead researcher on the study. \"\"But I didn't expect that it would be that much.\"\" Rizzo and his colleagues analyzed the diet, health and lifestyles of more than 700 adults. Using questionnaires on eating habits, the researchers categorized participants as vegetarians (eating meat of any kind less than once a month), semi-vegetarians (eating meat or poultry less than once a week), and non-vegetarians. The researchers also measured sugar, fat and cholesterol in the subjects' blood as well as blood pressure, waist size, and body mass index (BMI - a measurement of a person's weight relative to height). Vegetarians' average BMI of 25.7 was four points lower than that of non-vegetarians, who, on average, had BMIs close to 30. A BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight, and greater than 30 is considered obese. Semi-vegetarians fell in the middle, with a BMI and waist size smaller than non-vegetarians, but larger than vegetarians. The pattern held when the measurements were combined to determine the presence of metabolic syndrome. Rizzo told Reuters Health he is not sure what's behind the differences. \"\"Is it primarily the meat intake, the plant food intake or a combination of both?\"\" Rizzo said. It's also possible that diet is not the cause; the research showed only an association between food choices and health factors, not cause-and-effect. High BMI, for instance, one of the traits that make up the metabolic syndrome profile, itself contributes to high blood pressure, and indirectly, blood sugar, and thereby potentially raising a person's risk of heart disease and diabetes. The current study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, also did not follow the subjects over the long term to see whether those who abstained from meat actually had lower rates of diabetes or heart disease. The data for this research, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, came from the Adventist Health Study 2, a long term study of Seventh Day Adventists. This religious group has considerably more vegetarians than the general population. In this study, 35 percent of the subjects did not eat meat, whereas only about five percent of all Americans are vegetarian. One of the differences Rizzo discovered between the groups was age. Vegetarians, on average, were 3 years older than the meat-eaters. \"\"Even though they're older, they're in better shape,\"\" Rizzo said. \"\"That's something I found quite interesting.\"\" SOURCE: bit.ly/goHGBG Diabetes Care, online March 16, 2011.

WASHINGTON - The White House on Friday condemned Syria's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters and urged Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to promptly take concrete steps toward meaningful reform. \"\"The Syrian government has an important opportunity to be responsive to the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people,\"\" Jay Carney, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, said in a statement. \"\"Violence is not the answer to the grievances of the Syrian people.\"\" Syrian security forces killed nine protesters across the country Friday during anti-government protests, Arabic news daily Al-Arabiya reported citing witnesses and human rights activists. Syria's state news agency acknowledged for the first time that worshippers in Deraa and Latakia, scene of protests and deadly clashes last week, had gathered after Friday prayers to call for accelerated reforms. \"\"A number of worshippers left some mosques in the cities of Deraa and Latakia, chanting slogans in honour of the martyr and calling for speeding up measures for reform ... There were no clashes between worshippers and security forces in these gatherings,\"\" SANA said. Witnesses in the Damascus suburb of Douma said that three of those killed were among at least 2,000 people who chanted \"\"Freedom. Freedom. One, one, one. The Syrian people are one,\"\" when police opened fire to disperse them from Municipality Square. Two weeks of unprecedented unrest in Syria has left more than 60 dead and posed the gravest challenge to almost 50 years of monolithic Baath Party rule. Earlier, civic activists said protest marches had begun in the capital Damascus, Banias and the port city of Latakia against Assad's authoritarian rule after he stopped short of a clear commitment to meet popular demands for more freedoms. Security forces and Assad loyalists attacked protesters with batons as they left the Rifaii mosque in the Kfar Sousseh district of Damascus after Friday prayers, a witness said. At least six protesters were arrested and dozens were beaten as they made their way out of the mosque, the witness told Reuters by telephone from the mosque complex. Around 200 worshipers chanted slogans in support of the southern city of Deraa where the unrest kindled by pro-democracy uprisings elsewhere in the Arab world first erupted. Online democracy activists had called for protests across Syria on \"\"Martyrs' Friday\"\", after a spate of pro-democracy demonstrations challenging Assad's 11 years in power. His father, Hafez al-Assad, had ruled over the previous 30 years. Activists said security forces and Assad loyalists had earlier gathered in force around the mosques where protests resumed after Friday prayers. In his first public appearance since the demonstrations began, Assad declined on Wednesday to spell out any reforms, especially the lifting of a 48-year-old emergency law that has been used to stifle opposition and justify arbitrary arrests.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Jobless rate falls to 8.8% Washington • The nation's unemployment rate dropped to its lowest level in two years in March, and the outlook is brightening as major companies plan to add more jobs. Increased hiring cut the unemployment rate to 8.8 percent - an encouraging sign for the unemployed and for President Barack Obama's re-election prospects. Still, the job gains haven't led many people who stopped looking for work during the recession to start again. Fewer than two-thirds of American adults are either working or looking for work - the lowest participation rate in 25 years. The economy added 216,000 jobs last month, the government said Friday. Factories, retailers, the education and health care sectors, and professional and financial services all expanded payrolls. Those gains offset layoffs by local governments, construction and telecommunications. The improved outlook propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to a 2011 high in early trading. Stocks then pared their gains as oil prices climbed to 30-month highs. The Dow closed up about 57 points. The private sector added more than 200,000 jobs for a second straight month. It was the first time that's happened since 2006 - more than a year before the recession started. And it could mark a turning point in job creation. America's largest companies plan to step up hiring in the next six months, a March survey of CEOs found. Google, Siemens Corp. and Ford Motor Co., among others, have said they plan to add workers. Economists expect the stronger hiring to endure throughout the year, producing a net gain of about 2.5 million jobs for 2011. Even so, that would make up for only a small portion of the 7.5 million jobs wiped out during the recession. The economy must average up to 300,000 new jobs a month to significantly lower unemployment. Story continues below The unemployment rate has fallen a full percentage point since November, the sharpest four-month drop since 1983. Stepped-up hiring is the main reason. But a more sobering factor is that the number of people who are either working or seeking a job remains surprisingly low for this stage of the recovery. People without jobs who aren't looking for one aren't counted as unemployed. Once they start looking again, they're classified as unemployed, and the unemployment rate can go back up. That can happen even if the economy is adding jobs. Just 64.2 percent of adults have a job or are looking for one - the lowest participation rate since 1984. The number has been shrinking for four years. It suggests many people remain discouraged about their job prospects even as hiring is picking up. A falling unemployment rate is vital for Obama, who is 19 months from a re-election vote and facing a lineup of potential Republican challengers who will make his stewardship of the economy the dominant issue. President Ronald Reagan had low job-approval ratings in his first term, when unemployment surged to 10.4 percent. By Election Day 1984, the unemployment rate had sunk to 7.2 percent. Reagan won a landslide victory. \"\"Although we got good news today, we have to keep the momentum going,\"\" Obama told workers at a UPS shipping facility in suburban Maryland. \"\"There are still millions of Americans out there that are looking for a job that pays the bills.\"\" Just 15 percent of Americans surveyed in mid-March said the economy had improved in the past month, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll. That's a sharp decline from January, when 30 percent said so. And 28 percent said the economy would worsen. It's the largest percentage to say so since the question was first asked in December 2009.

In a televised address on Saturday morning, Laurent Gbagbo's military spokesman Lt. Col. Alphonse Guano called on security forces to report for duty and to resist attacks by fighters loyal to internationally recognized president Alassane Ouattara. A disheveled TV announcer said Gbagbo was at his residence Saturday and that it had not been attacked. In just five days, the force aiming to install the democratically elected Ouattara had succeeded in taking nearly 80 percent of Ivory Coast, before entering Abidjan and encircling both the presidential residence and the palace. Overnight, however, the shooting near the palace and the residence died down, suggesting that the armed group had been pushed back. A fighter with Ouattara's forces, Boubacar Drame, said that they were waiting for reinforcements. Gbagbo's Europe-based adviser Toussaint Alain told reporters in Paris that Gbagbo is still in his residence \"\"like Sarkozy at the Elysee and Obama at the White House,\"\" referring to the French and U.S. presidents. However, Gbagbo's whereabouts could not be confirmed Saturday and the phones of his close aides rang unanswered. And a resident living near Gbagbo's residence in Abidjan's Cocody neighborhood said that at around 9 a.m. the shooting restarted after a mostly quiet night. \"\"I am just 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) from the residence. There are volleys of shots,\"\" said Yeo N'Dri. Heavy machine-gun fire erupted just after noon at one end of the lagoonside highway leading to the palace, around two city blocks from the gate of the presidential compound. An adviser to Ouattara who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press said the loss of the TV station was a setback, but that Ouattara's forces were still at both the residence and the palace and were readying for battle. He said Ouattara told him fighters had surrounded the palace but that they stopped shooting, to give Gbagbo time to surrender overnight. \"\"He said there has been too much blood,\"\" said the adviser. \"\"Ouattara does not want for Gbagbo to die. But he also said that patience has a limit.\"\" The battle for the country's most important city has come at a terrible price. On Tuesday, the day after Ouattara's forces took the western town of Duekoue, intercommunal fighting broke out, killing at least 800 people, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Patrick Nicholson, spokesman for the Roman Catholic charity Caritas, told The Associated Press that Caritas workers visited one neighborhood in Duekoue that was filled with bodies of victims killed by gunshots and hacked to death with machetes. He estimates the death toll was as high as 1,000. It's unclear if Ouattara's forces were involved in the attack, and Duekoue has been the scene of communal violence before. Ouattara's government Saturday denied their fighters were involved in any atrocities, and blamed the killings on Gbagbo forces acting as they retreated. Gbagbo, 65, has not been seen in public since the offensive began, but those in his inner circle said Friday he was still in Abidjan and would fight until the end. Ouattara has ordered land and sea borders closed to seal all the exits in case Gbagbo attempts to flee. Ouattara's victory with 54 percent of the vote in last November's election was recognized first by the country's electoral commission and then by governments around the world. Leaders from U.S. President Barack Obama to French President Nicolas Sarkozy have made personal appeals to Gbagbo to step down. At least 1,500 foreign nationals have taken refuge since the offensive began at the French military base in Abidjan, said Cmdr. Frederic Daguillon, spokesman for the French forces in Ivory Coast.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Parole rule frees two after 17 years On Saturday, Fusi Mofokeng and Tshokolo Joseph Mokoena will walk out of Kroonstad Prison as free men – 17 years after being jailed for a crime they did not commit. The men were imprisoned for life for their supposed involvement with an ANC self-defence unit (SDU) that killed a policeman and caused permanent brain damage to a second near Bethlehem in the Free State. They were also jailed for 18 years for attempted murder and conspiracy to commit robbery. The State at the time claimed Mofokeng and Mokoena had conspired with the SDU to rob a smallholding in the area. A local farmer was shot. After nearly two decades of failed attempts at pleading their innocence to influential people from Thabo Mbeki to Desmond Tutu, a Constitutional Court judgment this week on who should handle the parole process for prisoners serving life sentences imposed before October 1, 2004, has ensured that the men will finally go home on Saturday. The judgment says the minister of correctional services will now consider the placement of lifers sentenced between August 1, 1987 and March 1, 1994, without the involvement of the National Council for Correctional Services (NCCS). “They (Mofokeng and Mokoena) were in tears when we told them that they would be free tomorrow,” said Jomo Nyambi (MP), the chairman of the Select Committee on Petitions and Members Legislative Proposals yesterday. “They just can’t wait for tomorrow.” In 2009, the chairperson of the National Council of Provinces was petitioned to refer the two men’s matter to Nyambi’s committee for investigation. But their situation meant years of legal action. Later that year, Jeremy Gordin, the director of the Justice Project of the Wits Journalism School, entered the fray and took up the cudgels for Mofokeng and Mokoena. The team realised that the solution for the men was to apply for parole. But then Minister of Correctional Services Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula proclaimed she could not grant anyone parole without a favourable recommendation from the NCCS and that she had to get clarity from the Constitutional Court before granting any paroles. On Thursday, the department welcomed the clarity provided by the Constitutional Court, and immediately started with the consideration for placement on parole of the 385 lifers who fell within this time period. But Nyambi, Gordin and their teams had even more to celebrate, when, hours later, Mapisa-Nqakula issued instructions that Mofokeng and Mokoena be released on Saturday. Nyambi, and his committee who all travelled to Joburg from Kroonstad to hear the Constitutional Court’s judgment, said yesterday: “This case is a clear indication of the travesty of justice under apartheid and utter disregard for the rights of our people.” Nyambi said the committee was happy with the co-operation it had received from the different parties. “Their release is one of the last steps that our nation is taking to put an end to a tragic past that destroyed many people’s lives, including the two who have spent almost two decades (in jail) for a crime they did not commit.” The Select Committee on Petitions and Members Legislative Proposals will attend the release of Mofokeng and Mokoena today at 11am at the Kroonstad Prison. * Meanwhile, Mapisa-Nqakula s a statement on Friday she would soon begin to process all the lifers who had been referred by the NCCS in recent years. The minister said steps had been taken to start the process as early as Monday. These steps will include adding extra administrative capacity to her office in an attempt to ensure the processing of the parole applications as quickly as possible. Maximum effort would also be made by the department to contact the victims of the crimes perpetrated by the remaining applicants, in line with the spirit of the White Paper on Corrections. Mapisa-Nqakula said she would announce decisions on the first 95 parole applications on April 8, and conclude decisions about the remaining 290 on May 15. Where necessary, lifers falling within this group of parole applicants may be temporarily all moved to one facility in an attempt to allow easier completion of processing by the Correctional Supervision and Parole Boards, who would not then have to spend time travelling to different prisons. “The Ministry of Correctional Services wishes to emphasise to both applicants and the South African public that being considered for parole does not automatically mean parole will be granted, as parole is a privilege dependent on specific and certain qualifying criteria and not a right,” Mapisa-Nqakula added. - Saturday Star ' \n",

Hundreds of people were marching in Douma, a suburb of the capital Damascus, for funerals to mourn those killed in the latest round of protests, which started two weeks ago. At least 80 people have died in clashes with security forces. Assad appointed Adel Safar, the former agriculture minister, to form the new Cabinet, Syria's state-run television said. Safar is seen as a respectable figure in a government that many had criticized for corruption. Assad sacked his government last week in answer to growing cries for reform in Syria, one of the most authoritarian regimes in the Middle East. On Thursday, he set up committees to look into the deaths of civilians during two weeks of unrest and replacing decades-old state of emergency laws. Safar, 58, holds a doctorate in agricultural sciences from the French polytechnic center in France and was the dean of Damascus University's agricultural faculty from 1997-2000. He also heads the Arab Center for Dry and Arid Areas. The extraordinary wave of protests has proved the most serious challenge yet to the Assad family's 40-year dynasty. The protests were touched off by the arrest of several teenagers who scrawled anti-government graffiti on walls in Daraa, a drought-parched and impoverished city in the south near the border with Jordan. Assad has blamed a \"\"foreign conspiracy\"\" for the unrest and offered gestures of reform that protesters say do not go far enough to satisfy their demands for real change. Human rights groups and eyewitnesses said a campaign of arrests was continuing Sunday as Assad tries to cut off the demonstrations. Ammar Qurabi, who heads Syria's National Organization for Human Rights, said at least 500 people were under arrest since protests began on March 18. ' \n",

Mr Safar's appointment came after Mr Assad fired his cabinet in a bid to quell pro-democracy protests but dashed hopes he would lift almost 50 years of emergency rule in a rare address. Mobile phone and internet networks failed yesterday in Syria \"\"due to an overload\"\", according to a customer representative, a day after authorities had carried out a wave of arrests in protest cities, after nine people were killed in protests for reform the day before. \"\"There is an arrest campaign and phone lines are down so people suspect interference, but the government says it is a technical problem,\"\" said a resident of Douma, north of Damascus. The wave of raids targeted the southern town of Daraa, one of the centres of more than two weeks of demonstrations, as well as Douma and the industrial city of Homs. In a joint statement, eight human rights groups said 46 people had been arrested, four people had died and dozens had been wounded in the crackdown. A Douma resident said the agricultural town was calm, despite security forces withholding some bodies from the previous day's deadly violence in an apparent bid to prevent funerals from sparking fresh protests. Witnesses said security forces had used live ammunition to disperse stone-throwing protesters after Friday prayers. Authorities denied the security forces were responsible for the deaths, blaming them on an \"\"armed group\"\" that fired from rooftops. Yusef Abu Rumiyeh, a member of parliament for Daraa, denounced security forces for opening fire on his constituents \"\"without pity\"\" and preventing the wounded from getting to hospital. \"\"The people of Hauran were waiting for President [Bashar] Assad to visit to offer his condolences. Had he done so, nothing that happened subsequently would have taken place,\"\" he said in a video posted on YouTube. \"\"Friday of Martyrs\"\" protests were also staged in the port of Latakia, Darriya, near the capital and the northeastern Kurdish towns of Qamishli and Amuda. Washington slammed the use of force and applauded the \"\"courage and dignity\"\" of demonstrators. But analysts said US President Barack Obama was not ready to throw his support behind the opposition. \"\"They are afraid that [Mr Assad] will not go gently into that good night and therefore they might try to create trouble, and that will create a civil war-type scenario,\"\" said Ammar Abdulhamid, a Washington-based Syrian dissident and democracy activist. \"\"[They fear it] will be either civil war or they will have to deal with an even more radicalised and anti-Western regime if the Assads came up in control again,\"\" he said. In Yemen, police fired teargas and live bullets at protesters holding an anti-regime demonstration in the city of Taez yesterday, killing one and wounding dozens. In the southern city of Aden, protesters hurled stones at riot police backed by tanks and duelling rallies were held in the capital Sanaa.

Campaigning in the southern districts of Madurai, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin on Sunday, she asked the voters to create history by making the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led combine lose deposits in all constituencies, thus creating a Guinness record .If the AIADMK was voted to power, Katchatheevu would be retrieved from Sri Lanka, she said addressing a meeting at Tuticorin early in the day. Enhanced social security for fishermen and farmers, road-over bridges, cold storage facilities and mechanised equipment for fishermen and an assistance of Rs.2,000 each during the 45-day fishing ban, industrial developments in Srivaikuntam and Tiruchendur were some of the promises made by Ms. Jayalaithaa. She also announced that nursing educational institutes would be set up in Tiruchendur and Nazareth. Later campaigning at Ambasamudram in Tirunelveli district, she said all welfare schemes introduced by the DMK regime were launched with an ulterior motive of ensuring substantial and constant revenue to the family of Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. \"\"A classic example is the distribution of free colour televisions, through which the family of Mr. Karunanidhi is getting annually a minimum of Rs.1,000 from each family through the cable connection, ensuring whopping and regular revenue,\"\" she said. The former Chief Minister said Mr. Karunanidhi, who managed to get ministerial berth in the Union government on a couple of occasions and ruled Tamil Nadu five times, had made his family the richest in Asia. His grandson Kalanithi Maran had been listed by leading magazine Forbes as 310th richest person in the world. \"\"If we can add together the holdings of Mr. Karunanidhi's, wives, sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters, no doubt, his family will be the richest in the world. Now you can understand as to why the State of Tamil Nadu has been entangled in the debt trap of over Rs.1 lakh crore,\"\" Ms. Jayalalithaa asked. She promised to desilt Kannadian, Nadhiyunni, South Kodaimelazhagiyaan and North Kodaimelazhagiyaan irrigation channels and erect barbed wire fence along the hamlets close to Western Ghats to prevent wild animal invasion into cultivated lands. In Madurai Addressing an election meeting at Kalavasal junction in Madurai seeking votes for the candidates of AIADMK-led alliance, she likened the polls to a \"\"second\"\" independence struggle to safeguard the State. Ms. Jayalalithaa said that under her rule Tamil Nadu was leading in economic growth and the law and order was maintained. But the State become backward under the DMK regime. \"\"Are the people of the State not working hard? Do they not have the habit of saving and do they not lead a thrift lifestyle. This is because the welfare schemes were formulated to further the interest of one family,\"\" she said. She said that the DMK-led government had failed on many fronts. Power cuts, spiralling price of essential commodities, deteriorating law and order situation, corruption and rice smuggling have hit people hard. . It was high time that this government was thrown out, she added. Security to Alagiri Referring to the alleged assault on government employees in Melur, Ms. Jayalalithaa said, \"\"Mr. Karunanidhi, was complaining about \"\"total\"\" withdrawal of police security to Union Minister, M.K. Alagiri. \"\"Why does he need police protection? There is no threat to him from the people. But, only the people face a threat from him,\"\" she said. Ms. Jayalalithaa said those involved in the murder of former DMK Minister, Tha. Kiruttinan, and in the burning of the office of Tamil Daily Dinakaran in Madurai in which three people were killed, were not punished. All those involved would be brought before the law and punished, if the AIADMK is voted to power, she added. \"\"The rule of law will be upheld when AIADMK comes back to power,\"\" she said, adding that police would be allowed to function independently. \"\"Rowdyism will be curbed with iron hand and Madurai would be converted into a spiritual and tourist spot,\"\" Ms. Jayalalithaa said. She promised to construct elevated roads in Madurai to ease traffic congestion, improve drinking water project and rectify the anomalies in underground drainage system. ' \n",

Experts debate pros, cons of highly programmed childhood THURSDAY, March 31 (HealthDay News) - From sports practices to music lessons to community service, American kids always seem to have plenty to keep them busy. But whether they're actually too busy - reaching a tipping point detrimental to their mental and physical health - remains a topic of debate. The subject of overscheduled children has been on scientists' radar for at least a decade, said Andrea Mata, a doctoral student at Kent State University whose recent study on highly involved children was scheduled for presentation Thursday at a symposium in Montreal run by the Society for Research in Child Development. \"\"I think it's a hot topic right now,\"\" Mata said. \"\"There's definitely a mix of viewpoints. So I think a lot more research is needed to find out what's going on.\"\" The SRCD symposium will examine which children and adolescents become overscheduled, what happens at high levels of extracurricular involvement, and how factors such as school grades and aggression levels are affected. Between 70 percent and 83 percent of American children and teens claim to take part in at least one extracurricular pursuit, spending an average of five to nine hours per week in structured activities, according to the SRCD. Only 5 percent to 7 percent, however, devote more than 20 hours per week to these activities. Jean Twenge, author of the book Generation Me and a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, said data gathered between the 1950s and the 1990s indicated overscheduling rose during that period and then leveled off. \"\"Are kids really overscheduled? It's not the average experience, but that doesn't mean it's not a problem,\"\" Twenge said. \"\"Parents worry about keeping up, but it's certain types of parents who worry about it.\"\" Twenge said the ever-mounting competition for admission to the nation's top colleges compels some parents and kids to fill every spare hour with impressive-looking endeavors. Mata's study followed 1,354 children from birth through age 15, dividing them into groups based on how involved they were outside of school and home. The 43 children in the highest activity level averaged 129 minutes per week of structured activities at kindergarten, which increased to 254 minutes weekly by fifth grade. Highly involved children were more likely to be girls from more affluent families, Mata said, and their mothers had attained higher education levels. This group had higher grades and lower levels of delinquency, among other behavioral and academic measurements, compared to less-involved children, she said. \"\"We're looking at it in a much more positive way,\"\" Mata said. \"\"These highly involved kids are highly adaptive and high-functioning.\"\" Linda Balog, former executive director of the Child and Adolescent Stress Management Institute at State University of New York at Brockport, said parents should ask their children how they feel about their extracurricular pursuits and whether they feel overwhelmed and stressed. \"\"We see some kids forced into organized sports at early ages and then get so burned out that they opt not to play in high school,\"\" said Balog, an associate professor of health sciences who's teaching a course on child and adolescent stress. \"\"Sometimes parents live through their children - a sort of surrogate self,\"\" she added. \"\"I think we have to err on the side of backing off a bit . . . as opposed to everything being organized and structured.\"\" Experts note that research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Mehmet Toner, study leader and a professor of biomedical engineering at Harvard Medical School, and Brian Wardle, an MIT associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics, have created an instrument that could eventually allow doctors to see if cancer has spread from its original site faster than ever. Circulating tumor cells, which are cancer cells that escaped from the original tumor, can be difficult to find because a 1-milliliter sample of blood, which has tens of billions of normal blood cells, only contains \"\"several\"\" circulating tumor cells. \"\"Of all deaths from cancer, 90 percent are not the result of cancer at the primary site,\"\" said Wardle. \"\"They're from tumors that spread from the original site.\"\" In response to this dilemma, Toner created a new microfluidic device capable of detecting these circulating tumor cells. He originally designed the device four years ago, and it worked by allowing a patient's blood sample to travel past tens of thousands of little silicon posts that are covered with antibodies. These antibodies stick to tumor cells, and any cancer cells that touch the silicon posts are caught and held in place. The problem with this prototype was that certain cells might never come in contact with the silicon posts at all. Toner has since made changes to the device with the help of Wardle, making it eight times better than the original. The microfluidic device now features porous posts instead of those that are solid, which were made using carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotubes are small, hollow cylinders that have walls made of carbon atom lattices. A \"\"forest\"\" of these nanotubes have 10 billion to 100 billion carbon nanotubes per square centimeter, and are 99 percent air and less than 1 percent carbon. Much like the original version, these carbon nanotubes are coated with antibodies that capture particular cancer cells. The device is also customizable, allowing researchers to attach different antibodies to the carbon nanotubes or adjusting the space between the nanotubes in order to catch objects of different sizes, from circulating tumor cells to viruses. The porous posts allow cells to run through them, much like a filter, offering greater chance of catching the cells researchers are looking for. Toner and Wardle's device is currently being tested in hospitals and is expected to be made available commercially \"\"within the next few years.\"\" In addition, researchers hope to adjust the device for HIV diagnosis as well.

A New Study Says No Despite concerns that date back to the early days of emissions trading, a U.S. EPA program that lets coal-fired power plants buy and sell the right to pollute hasn't hit poor people and minorities with dirtier air than everyone else, according to a new study (pdf). Long before greens rallied around cap and trade as their preferred way to slow global warming, many of them raised doubts about Congress' plan to let companies swap allowances for the emissions that form acid rain. Environmental justice advocates worried that the free market could lead to toxic \"\"hotspots,\"\" cutting pollution overall but concentrating the rest of it in vulnerable areas. Over the first 15 years of U.S. EPA's Acid Rain Program, the opposite has occurred, says Evan Ringquist, a professor at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Past research shows that poor people and minorities are more likely to live in places with dirty air. But under the trading program, industrial plants in those neighborhoods bought fewer licenses to pollute, according to Ringquist's new study, which will appear in the upcoming issue of Social Science Quarterly . Market-based programs have generally been more efficient than command-and-control rules, and the new study adds to the evidence that those savings do not come at the cost of greater inequality, Ringquist said. \"\"In general, the research shows that most of the early fears haven't come to pass,\"\" he told Greenwire . Emissions that lead to acid rain have fallen across the board since EPA started trading programs for sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) under the Clean Air Act. Data released by the agency last week show that the coal plants in the programs released 5.11 million tons of SO2 and 2.05 million tons of NOx last year - down 67.5 percent and 69.2 percent, respectively, from 1990 levels. Both types of pollution are also linked to health problems. When released into the air, SO2 forms fine soot that is linked to breathing problems, heart attacks and death, while NOx is one of the chemicals that typically causes smog problems in urban areas. Since trading began, some critics have predicted that minority neighborhoods would see fewer health benefits today because nearby companies would buy pollution credits rather than add equipment to control their emissions. In a 1999 article, several legal scholars decried Southern California's trading program for SO2 and NOx as a \"\"failed experiment\"\" for that reason. \"\"Pollution trading in Los Angeles has led to concentrated toxic air emission hotspots that have shackled low-income and minority communities with the region's air pollution,\"\" they wrote in the Duke Environmental Law and Policy Forum. But the new study says the nationwide trading program may have narrowed the pollution gap between whites and minorities, especially Latinos. It adds to the findings of groups such as the Environmental Law Institute, Environmental Defense Fund and Resources for the Future, all of which looked at the trading program about a decade ago and concluded it was not causing hotspots. Based on an empirical analysis of all swaps that took place between January 1995 and March 2009, Ringquist found that for every 10 percent increase in the percentage of Hispanic households in a certain ZIP code, there was a 4.1 percent decrease in the chance that a nearby facility would buy more SO2 allowances than it sold. If the proportion of black households within a mile of an industrial plant increased by 10 percent, the facility was 0.8 percent less likely to be an \"\"importer\"\" of pollution credits. \"\"If there is an equity effect from allowance trading in this model, it works to the advantage of communities of color,\"\" the study says. Still, a trading program does not require the air to be equally clean in all areas. Industrial plants bought more credits than they sold in places where large percentages of people did not finish high school, Ringquist found. Surprisingly, the same was true in areas where homeowners - rather than renters - made up a larger share of the population. Wider implications Though the acid rain program has been widely touted as a success and embraced by most environmental groups, concerns about toxic - and discriminatory - hotspots have lingered as policymakers have debated ways to cut pollution. The fear of hotspots was often raised by critics as the George W. Bush administration tried to take a market-based approach to mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. In 2005, before the Clean Air Mercury Rule was thrown out in federal court, EPA's inspector general released a report saying that the agency had not done enough to ensure that the emissions trading plan would not lead to mercury hotspots ( E&ENews PM , May 5, 2005). And while there is no worry about local emissions of carbon dioxide, because it isn't toxic, the idea that trading programs will lead to hotspots has regardless been raised as governments have tried to limit the greenhouse gases that are linked to climate change. When the state of California's cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide was stalled in court last week, it was because of a challenge from local activists, who say the trading program will have the side effect of exposing their neighborhoods to other types of toxic pollution. San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Ernest Goldsmith ruled that the Air Resources Board had not given enough attention to the idea of putting a tax on every ton of carbon released into the air. Neither option would guarantee cleaner air in Wilmington, Calif., a city with three refineries nearby and a population that is about 87 percent Latino, said Jesse Marquez, executive director of Coalition for a Safe Environment. \"\"Even if you put in a tax, a tax still allows refiners to continue polluting,\"\" Marquez said. \"\"They'll just spend millions to offset their pollution. The only way to offset refiner pollution is to eliminate refiner pollution\"\" ( Greenwire , March 24). If the new analysis of the acid rain programs are any indication, there isn't necessarily a tension between efficiency and fairness, said Michael Livermore, a law professor at New York University and executive director of the school's Institute for Policy Integrity. That is promising for market-based efforts, but it is not a guarantee that future cap-and-trade systems will turn out the same way, he said. \"\"We don't need to trust in our luck,\"\" Livermore said. \"\"We can design our programs to reduce the risk of hotspots.\"\" Click here (pdf) to read the study.

Still fewer get to blow things up there. And only one man has the distinction of blowing up a piece of real estate at the South Pole that he once called home. \"\"It was a little sad, but the day goes on,\"\" said John Rand, a consulting engineer with the U.S. Army's Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL). Last December, the Antarctic Sun recently reported, Rand was part of a crew charged with dynamiting a piece of history - the very first permanent dwelling ever built at the South Pole. [Related: Extreme Living: Scientists at the End of the Earth.] In the decades since it was constructed in the mid 1950s, the long-abandoned outpost was swallowed up by the ever-shifting snows of the frozen continent. And, after a frightening accident, the original South Pole station had to go. Rand, a specialist in drilling ice cores - long cylinders of ice pulled up from glaciers - passed his first South Pole stay at the station, a four-month exercise in long hours, isolation and bachelor living, from late 1971 to early 1972.  Even then, the station was 15 or 20 feet (4.5 or 6 meters) below the surface. Chambers called top hats - giant boxes with roughly the same dimensions as the station's identical buildings - had been stacked atop the structures to keep their roofs above the snow, which tends to compact and thus sink under a building while snow blows in and piles up around it. \"\"In essence, the terrain is rising,\"\" said George L. Blaisdell, operations manager for the National Science Foundation's U.S. Antarctic Program, who explained that the physics at work at the South Pole makes building there difficult. \"\"The elevation at the South Pole hasn't changed in the last 50 years,\"\" Blaisdell told OurAmazingPlanet, \"\"but if you put something on the surface and came back a year later, it would be further down in the snowpack.\"\" That's precisely what happened to the old South Pole station. By the time Rand helped blow the station up in December, it was 30 feet (9 meters) below the surface. However, the long-abandoned station once played a pivotal role in scientific and world history. First in, never out The original station was a no-frills military affair - essentially a series of glorified boxes made from sturdy wooden beams and plywood. The research base was built by the Seabees, the Navy's construction unit; building on the structure began in late 1956 and the station was dedicated in January 1957. The project stemmed from the International Geophysical Year (IGY), an 18-month period of coordinated scientific endeavor from July 1957 to December 1958, when countries including the United States, the then Soviet Union and several European nations sent thousands of researchers out into the wild and little-explored regions of the planet to push the boundaries of Earth science. The Americans christened the base the Amundsen-Scott IGY South Pole Station, to honor the only other humans to ever set foot at the Pole ahead of the seminal construction. People had first and last been to the Pole nearly five decades earlier in 1911, during the famed race that pitted Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen against doomed Englishman Robert Falcon Scott. (Amundsen won the race, and Scott died on the return journey from the pole.) [Related: In Images - Race for the South Pole.] At the conclusion of the IGY, when the time came to pack up and go home, the Americans decided to stay put in their little station at 90 degrees south latitude. Not only was great science happening at the South Pole, but a permanent U.S. station at the literal convergence of the planet's longitude lines had enormous strategic value. \"\"The U.S. felt that by being at the geographic South Pole, we would have something of a claim, if you will,\"\" Blaisdell said, \"\"and having been there longer than anyone else, be able to put pressure on other people trying to divvy up Antarctica.\"\" The Americans' extended stay in Antarctica and at the Pole was one of several geopolitical circumstances that paved the way for the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959 - the world's first nuclear arms agreement and a milestone international decision to leave the frozen continent free of territorial claims by any country. The treaty is still in force today. Danger zone The original Amundsen-Scott station was largely abandoned in 1974 for a newer station nearby, constructed under a dome. That station, in turn, was recently abandoned for a brand new Amundsen-Scott facility, dedicated in 2008 - a gleaming construction perched atop 36 stilts that can be ratcheted higher when the snow begins to encroach. Rand said the original station, invisible beneath the snow, was marked out on the surface by flags that covered an area about 150 by 300 to 400 feet (45 by 90 to 120 meters). To prepare to demolish the station, Rand and his colleagues drilled a warren of holes down to the topmost level of the buried station and threaded dynamite down into the snow. Over the course of three days in early December, the charges were detonated, collapsing the roof of the station and creating a large crater in the snow. Rand said it was with mixed emotions that he watched the explosions shoot snow high into the air. \"\"It was truly the end of that station. The year before it was intact and now it's put to bed,\"\" Rand said. However, he said, it had to be done. The area was dangerous. A year earlier, despite the visible network of flags marking the perimeter of the site, a giant tractor somehow ended up atop the former station. The snow collapsed beneath the weight of the massive machine, which crashed through the top roof of the old station. The driver wasn't hurt, but ended up at the bottom of a 30-foot (9-m) hole. He was quickly retrieved by crews on harnesses, but getting the tractor out proved to be tricky. The accident was a wake-up call, according to Blaisdell and Rand, and the wheels were put in motion to remove the danger. Video Link: http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/U0d_3vjt4Gk?fs=1&hl=en_US&rel=0 \"\"A year before a friend almost got hurt badly, and we needed to solve that problem,\"\" Rand said. \"\"And that's what we did.\"\" The giant crater that remains where the station once stood has already begun to fill up with snow, and Blaisdell said the area would be safe for new construction soon, perhaps as early as 2013. With its high altitude, dry conditions and extreme vantage point, the South Pole offers some of the best observing conditions on Earth, and the newly opened-up real estate is highly coveted among scientists brimming with ideas. \"\"It's just a matter of deciding which ones have the best possible payoff,\"\" Blaisdell said.   *   North vs. South Poles: 10 Wild Differences    *   Extreme Living: Scientists at the End of the Earth    *   The Coldest Places on Earth  Copyright © 2011 LiveScience.com.

The teenage girl was a victim of incest, and all that she endured, all the emotional damage that she carried, she buried. \"\"She just had bottled up her emotions, all this pain. She just couldn't feel anymore,\"\" said Jeff Johnston, a psychotherapist with Cape Girardeau-based Associated Counseling Services. By the time the teen came to Johnston, she had been in and out of home placement, removed from her family. By the time she came to Johnston, she had discovered a dangerous relief. The girl was a cutter, tearing her flesh with a paper clip or a razor blade to achieve a kind of curious release, a bloody catharsis. \"\"She resorted to hurting herself so she could feel something,\"\" he said. Johnston has worked in counseling services for nearly a quarter-century, and this cutter was the worst case of self-injurious behavior he said he's seen. He said he has seen more clients battling self-injury in recent years, most of them young, more female than male. He sees them as young as middle school, and the incidents of cutting tend to get worse as they get older. While there are conflicting statistics on prevalence, there are signs that self-injury, or self-mutilation as it also is called, is on the rise, according to research analysis from Cornell University and the University of Rochester. Guidance counselors and mental health specialists in Southeast Missouri say the numbers aren't epidemic but that the incidents are alarming. In her first few years as a counselor at Perry County Middle School, Barb Macke learned of a group of boys who were cutting themselves. She had never heard of such behavior, and it was terrifying. Macke did some research and found behavioral science theories suggesting cutting might be an indicator of suicidal thoughts. The boys were recommended for counseling, and the four friends didn't appear to have any subsequent problems. It seemed more of a machismo thing, young teens trying to show how tough they were. For several years, Macke said cutting seemed to disappear from the list of adolescent problems. It has resurfaced, she said. This year, she has worked with the parents of a sixth-grader who was cutting himself with the wire from his loose-leaf notebook. She has seen others who have cut deeper, most for similar reasons. When confronted, some have claimed their marks and scars are cat scratches. \"\"These are very uniform, almost parallel marks, obviously not a cat scratch,\"\" the counselor said. After seeing a half a dozen cutters last school year, Macke said she knows of only a couple of confirmed cases at the middle school this year. The numbers are difficult to track; there are few comprehensive studies on self-injury, and the research often is contradictory. Broad estimates indicate about 1 percent of the total U.S. population, perhaps as many as 3 million Americans, show signs of self-injurious behavior. Another study in the Journal of Clinical Psychology reported rates of 4 percent. A 2004 British study, \"\"Young People and Self-Harm,\"\" estimates 10 percent of people ages 11 to 25 self-injure. Research suggests females are only somewhat more likely to self-injure than males, according to the New York universities fact sheet. While it may seem paradoxical, cutters see self-injury as a coping mechanism - an unhealthy coping mechanism, Johnston said, but a way to relieve stress, anxiety, frustration, fear, nonetheless. \"\"It appears these kids have a lot of internalized emotions they haven't coped with, and they are looking to express the pain,\"\" he said. It's often about control, mental health care professionals say. Cutters often feel like hurting themselves is one of the few actions over which they have control. Some seek to purify themselves or to re-enact a trauma. Cutters come from all backgrounds. Ruth Ward, social worker for the Jackson School District, said she has seen the stereotypical \"\"good student\"\" struggling with cutting issues. What most have in common, she said, is they are looking for something. \"\"I think it can be a cry for help,\"\" Ward said. \"\"I think a lot of times, if a person is a true cutter, they are doing it to get a sense of relief from the anxiety or the built-up emotions.\"\" Johnston said some kind of dysfunction - abuse, divorce, a bitter custody battle - is a common thread among self-abusers. Cutting, research suggests, can become addictive. As painful as it may seem to carve or mutilate the skin, cutters come to depend on the release of endorphins, clinical experts say. The progression to sharper instruments and deeper cuts becomes part of the demanding high. \"\"The process can be likened to that of a growing drug addiction, where at first, small amounts provide a sense of calm and well-being,\"\" says the Self-Injury Fact Sheet from the New York universities. \"\"As tolerance builds, the user needs increasing amounts to achieve the same effect.\"\" \"\"I had a student who had scarred her body,\"\" Ward said. The teen received psychiatric help, she said, and appears to be doing better. While there is debate in the psychiatric community, Johnston said self-injury appears to decrease suicidal thoughts and action. For most it serves as a temporary release, he said. Though he said he hates to use the word in the context of cutting, Johnston sees some self-injury among teens almost as a fad. \"\"Some kids even identify around it, like it's cool to be a cutter,\"\" he said. \"\"That's always a scary thing when you see a child falling into that category, where they feel affirmed because they are a cutter.\"\" Ward said Jackson Middle School dealt with a copycat situation a couple of years ago, when a true cutter experiencing emotional problems was imitated by friends. On another occasion, a number of students tried cutting after reading a book detailing a young person's struggle with self-mutilation. They used the book as a manual to injure themselves. \"\"It was very scary,\"\" Ward said. \"\"We had to address that with the whole group of students involved.\"\" Johnston believes cutters, like alcoholics, are always in a state of recovery. The tendency is always there. Johnston employs cognitive behavior therapy, helping clients recognize emotional triggers and correcting distorted forms of thinking. For many teens, particularly girls, he said journaling is an effective and positive form of coping. And he encourages self-abusers to openly express their emotions with safe people in their lives. It is important to substitute a more positive coping strategy and not just eliminate the self-injury, according to the Self-Injury Fact Sheet. Cutters will sometimes replace self-injury with other self-destructive behaviors, such as drug abuse. Anti-depressants also have been found to reduce some of the urge to self-injure, the fact sheet says.

Researchers at the University of Melbourne have said that an expanding waistline puts men in danger of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD), reports the Daily Mail. Even small increases in waist size seem to raise the risk of AMD by up to 75%. But women do not appear to be affected. The difference between the sexes is thought to be due to the female hormone oestrogen. Abdominal fat releases oestrogen into the body and animal studies suggested the hormone could cause inflammation in blood vessels at the back of the eyes. Women have higher levels of oestrogen all their lives and so seem less sensitive to its effects. The researchers monitored changes in the waistlines of more than 21,000 men and women, aged between 40 and 69, over several years and tracked how many went on to develop AMD. \"\"There is evidence that chronic inflammation is involved in AMD and obesity is a pro-inflammatory state,\"\" said the scientists. The results showed that even small changes in a man's waist/hip ratio led to a sharp increase in risk. A healthy score is usually anything below a ratio of around 0.95. Anything above that raises the risk of diabetes and heart disease. But the Australian team found that for each increase of 0.1 in the waist/hip ratio, a man's chances of developing AMD soared by 75%.

The ripples detected in Saturn's rings date back to 1983, while the disruption to Jupiter's lesser-known rings was caused in 1994, Nasa researchers believe. The culprit, in the case of Jupiter, was comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, whose debris cloud hurtled through the planet's thin ring system during a kamikaze course into the planet in July 1994. Scroll down for video Saturn's ripples were caused by a similar object - likely another cloud of comet debris - plunging through the inner rings in the second half of 1983. Lead author Dr Matthew Hedman, from Cornell University, New York, said: \"\"What's cool is we're finding evidence that a planet's rings can be affected by specific, traceable events that happened in the last 30 years, rather than a hundred million years ago. \"\"The solar system is a much more dynamic place than we gave it credit for.\"\" From Nasa orbiter Galileo's visit to Jupiter, scientists have known since the late 1990s about patchy patterns in the Jovian ring. But the Galileo images were fuzzy, and so didn't explain why such patterns would occur. The trail was cold until Cassini entered orbit around Saturn in 2004 and started sending back thousands of images. A 2007 paper by Dr Hedman and colleagues first noted corrugations in Saturn's innermost ring, dubbed the D ring. A group including Dr Hedman and Dr Mark Showalter, from the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, then realised that the grooves in the D ring appeared to wind together more tightly over time. Playing the process backward, Dr Hedman then demonstrated the pattern originated when something tilted the D ring off its axis by about 100metres in late 1983. The scientists found the influence of Saturn's gravity on the tilted area warped the ring into a tightening spiral. Cassini imaging scientists got another clue when the sun shone directly along Saturn's equator and lit the rings edge-on in August 2009. The unique lighting conditions highlighted ripples not previously seen in another part of the ring system. Whatever happened in 1983 was not a small, localised event - it was big. The collision had tilted a region more than 12,000miles wide, covering part of the D ring and the next outermost ring, called the C ring. Unfortunately, spacecraft were not visiting Saturn at that time, and the planet was on the far side of the sun, hidden from telescopes on or orbiting Earth, so whatever happened in 1983 passed unnoticed by astronomers. Dr Hedman and Dr Showalter began to wonder whether the long-forgotten pattern in Jupiter's ring system might illuminate the mystery. Using Galileo images from 1996 and 2000, Dr Showalter confirmed a similar winding spiral pattern. They applied the same maths they had applied to Saturn - but now with Jupiter's gravitational influence factored in. Unwinding the spiral pinpointed the date when Jupiter's ring was tilted off its axis to between June and September 1994. Shoemaker-Levy plunged into the Jovian atmosphere during late July 1994. The estimated size of the nucleus was also consistent with the amount of material needed to disturb Jupiter's ring. The Galileo images also revealed a second spiral, which was calculated to have originated in 1990. Images taken by New Horizons in 2007, when the spacecraft flew by Jupiter on its way to Pluto, showed two newer ripple patterns, in addition to the fading echo of the Shoemaker-Levy impact. \"\"We now know that collisions into the rings are very common - a few times per decade for Jupiter and a few times per century for Saturn,\"\" Dr Showalter said. \"\"Now scientists know that the rings record these impacts like grooves in a vinyl record, and we can play back their history later.\"\" The ripples also give scientists clues to the size of the clouds of cometary debris that hit the rings. In each of these cases, the nuclei of the comets - before they likely broke apart - were a few kilometres wide. The findings are detailed in a pair of papers published online today in the journal Science. ' \n",

The rates of smoking-related deaths in men were comparable to what's been found in other recent analyses. The numbers for the women, however, were higher than expected. The study, published in the journal Epidemiology, is \"\"an important reminder that this huge epidemic...needs ongoing measurement,\"\" said Dr. Prabhat Jha, who studies smoking mortality and heads the Center for Global Health Research at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. \"\"We just can't assume that we know enough about where this epidemic is going,\"\" Jha, who was not involved in the current study, told Reuters Health. For the new report, Dr. Brian Rostron, then of the University of California, Berkeley, used data from a national health survey that asked nearly 250,000 people if and how much they smoked currently and in the past. Participants were tracked for 2 to 9 years after filling out the survey. By the time the study ended, in 2006, about 17,000 of them had died. Rostron, who now works at the Food and Drug Administration, calculated the odds of dying for smokers and non-smokers of different ages and genders. Then he applied the extra risks due to smoking to the total U.S. population. According to his calculations, there were an average of about 290,000 smoking-related deaths in men each year between 2002 and 2006 and 230,000 in women - a total of over half a million deaths. In all, about 2.5 million people in the U.S. die every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among all current and former smokers, the greatest increase in risk of a tobacco-related death was seen between the ages of 65 and 74. Once other factors such as weight and alcohol consumption were taken into account, people in that age group were three times as likely to die from any cause if they currently smoked between one and two packs of cigarettes a day, compared to if they had never smoked. As evidence of the risks of smoking has accumulated and spread, the number of current smokers in the U.S. has dropped over the past few decades. A new study in The Journal of the American Medical Association confirms that trend: about 7 percent of adults in the U.S. were heavy smokers in 2007, compared to 23 percent in 1965. The researchers on that study, led by Dr. John Pierce of the University of California, San Diego, defined \"\"heavy smoking\"\" as 20 or more cigarettes a day. Despite that good news, Jha said the new estimates show the need for more information on how smoking affects women. \"\"It might well be that in women the effects are greater and more severe, but we need more evidence,\"\" he said. Jha added that while rates of smoking and deaths from smoking have been falling over the long term in the U.S., they've been rising in low-income countries. Because of that, \"\"overall the number of smoking-related deaths worldwide is bound to increase,\"\" Jha said. Currently, there are about 5 to 6 million smoking-related deaths each year worldwide, he said. ' \n",

Experts say field is in its infancy and consumers should seek professional opinions on results FRIDAY, April 1 (HealthDay News) - At-home pregnancy tests can tell you unequivocally in minutes whether a baby is on the way and if it is time to call your doctor. But, at-home genetic tests - which may offer tantalizing clues about future health risks - are still in their infancy, and genetic counselors are concerned that the results may puzzle or even panic consumers who don't seek professional guidance. The explosion of direct-to-consumer genetic tests over the past several years has made it seemingly simple to test for a wide variety of medical scenarios. A swab of the cheek or a vial of blood can discern whether one is a carrier of an inherited disorder such as cystic fibrosis, for instance, or predict the risk for diseases such as breast cancer or Parkinson's. Newer tests purportedly predict how people might respond to a specific drug or medical treatment. But shelling out several hundred dollars or more for one of these tests - which are widely available online - does not equip consumers to understand the findings or their repercussions, genetic counselors say. Because people might base medical decisions on the results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration decided this month to restrict the tests on a case-by-case basis. \"\"To me, it's still very much in the recreational realm,\"\" said Caroline Lieber, a genetic counselor and director of the graduate program in human genetics at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, N.Y. \"\"The concern I have is the majority of the people feel knowledge is power, whereas most haven't thought through the implications at all.\"\" The U.S. Human Genome Project, begun 21 years ago to map out which genes are responsible for both physical and functional traits, led to unprecedented knowledge about how genes affect people's propensity for dozens of traits and conditions. But few predicted at the outset the complications that capitalism might create. A recent undercover study of 15 direct-to-consumer tests by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found \"\"egregious examples of deceptive marketing, in addition to poor or non-existent advice from supposed consultation experts,\"\" according to a recent report in The Lancet . The bottom line, Lieber said, is that an increasing number of companies' bottom lines are impacted by people's desires to live longer, healthier lives. \"\"My sense right now is it's very much about those companies making money,\"\" said Lieber, whose human genetics master's program at Sarah Lawrence is the nation's first and largest. \"\"The cynic in me says they're doing it mostly to make money, but I do think that's changing. Now phone counseling is being offered, and it's better than not having anything.\"\" Whether conducted by phone, Internet or in person, such counseling - if done by qualified experts - can help translate hard science into information that the average consumer can understand. For example, if a genetic test shows a low risk of diabetes, that doesn't mean that diet, exercise and other healthy lifestyle measures aren't necessary, said Dr. Robb Rowley, an internal medicine physician at Amigenics, a Las Vegas-based genetic testing and counseling group. \"\"At this point, I still recommend genetic testing be done through a health-care provider,\"\" said Rowley, whose patients mostly consult on their predisposition to cancer. \"\"Some have dire consequences . . . and without having a physician involved, people might do something [to change their lives] that they wouldn't otherwise do.\"\" Lieber said she thinks most who order at-home tests are unaware counseling exists to help them interpret the results. Others, she suspects, don't want the scrutiny of outsiders knowing their personal medical history. \"\"Probably my biggest concern is to have them understand genetic counselors are not there to tell people what to do. I think that's a misperception about the field,\"\" she said. But, \"\"if the results make them view themselves not as a person, but as a carrier for something - if they haven't thought about it - it can truly be damaging.\"\" Rowley said the ultimate scenario, which he predicts is five to 10 years out, is to be able to use each individual's unique DNA to optimize their care. \"\"The goal in the future is to be able to take that individual and say, \"\"Don't worry about osteoporosis, let's focus on your cardiovascular health, and by the way, this medication has a 40 percent chance of working for you,\"\"\"\" Rowley said. \"\"To a limited extent, we're there now.\"\" ' \n",

The car is a mid-size sedan that offers some hints at the future blueprint for mid-size sedans from Hyundai. The car is a FCEV or a Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle that is powered by hydrogen and is an attempt by Hyundai to capture some leadership for the emerging fuel cell vehicle market. There are some huge hurdles for FCEVs though, namely an infrastructure around the world for producing and distributing hydrogen. Hyundai notes that the Blue 2 concept has a stack power of 90kW and a fuel economy of 34.9km/L. The car has special low-resistance tires and light alloy wheels to reduce weight and help extend the driving range of the car. The concept has LED screen panels on the exterior of the car that allow the driver to see the vehicles status located on the front and rear. The car also has a welcome system that recognizes the driver and automatically opens the door. The concept has no side mirrors, using cameras on the sides mounted on the roof allowing the driver to see behind the car. The dash of the car uses OLED panels rather than normal gauges. While Hyundai is showing off its new concept car, a few details on the production hybrids from Hyundai and Kia have surfaced at Wards Auto. In other Hyundai news, Wards Auto reports that the Hyundai Sonata hybrids have been promised for delivery to the U.S. in later-April. The car has been officially on sale since December of 2010, but few dealers have actually been able to get the cars in stock. Hyundai reports that the delay in delivery was to give the automaker time to remove a switch that was integrated into the vehicles that allowed the driver to disable a warning system that makes noise to alert blind pedestrians. Wards notes that the car has been criticized by reviewers for having real world fuel economy that is much lower than the published EPA ratings. Hyundai spokesman Jim Trainor says, \"\"The slow rollout has nothing to do with some of the early results that folks got.\"\" “Even with the early prototypes that were making the rounds last fall (in California), many media got well over 40 mpg on the drive,” Trainor says, adding “production units will be better.” While the Sonata Hybrid is being promised by the end of the month, its kissing cousin - the Kia Optima Hybrid - has been set to go on sale in the U.S. in Q2 rather than the January 2011 launch that Kia originally planned.

Scientists are concerned about the damage that the BP oil spill may have done to the 2,000-year-old coral in the Gulf of Mexico. USGS scientist Nancy Prouty said, \"\"They're extremely old and extremely slow-growing. And there are big questions about their vulnerability and their ability for recovery.\"\" These black coral colonies are important in the ocean because they provide a place for fish and other marine life to live. They are extremely slow growing, so any damage they may have suffered will take centuries to fix. The BP oil spill has been a terrible tragedy for the Gulf of Mexico during this past year. If these corals have been seriously damaged, that is just another tragedy to add to the disaster. Because the corals feed on organic matter that sinks to the floor of the ocean, scientists believe that it will take a long time for it to recover from a disturbance in its ecosystem. The USGS is still working to determine if the BP oil spill has damaged the 2,000-year-old coral. Maps show the underwater slick moving away from the coral, but some dead corals have been found. This could have been due to the fact that the oil slick on top of the water was over the black coral colony during the spill. The BP oil spill has been terrible.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'How NoSQL Is Helping Allay Seattle's Radiation Fears Researchers at the University of Washington utilized the Cloudant NoSQL database as part of an experiment that determined radiation levels in Seattle as a result of the recent Fukushima nuclear disaster are “well below alarming limits.” The research team, which includes Cloudant Founder and Chief Scientist Mike Miller (his other title is research associate professor of physics), studied particles captured from the five air filters at the university’s Physics and Astronomy building and used Cloudant’s CouchDB-based BigCouch database to store and process the data from its experiments. The research team's shielded germanium detector and data acquisition hardware. The team’s results show radioactive particles first reached Seattle on March 17, but they were less abundant in volume and type than was expected based on research carried out after the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. In fact, the project’s official website states, “We stress that the overall amount of the radioactivity is extremely low, at least thousands of times below EPA limits.” Miller attributes the difference in radiation levels resulting from Chernobyl to the fact that the reactor at Chernobyl “was operating at full steam when it exploded,” whereas his team’s research suggests the Fukushima plant’s automatic safety system must have kicked in when the earthquake hit, turning off the reactor in the process. Miller’s association with Cloudant certainly influenced his team’s decision to use the product, but BigCouch — which is more big-data-focused than its web-application-focused NoSQL counterparts — is particularly well-suited for this type of job. According to Miller, the team created “a MacGuyver-like setup” in order to start monitoring radiation levels in a hurry. After installing the special air filters and sampling “gigantic quantities of air,” the trapped particles were run through a germanium detector to determine the unique fingerprints of isotopes created by nuclear fission. Miller says the general belief is that radioactive isotopes travel through the air attached to dust particles or concrete particles from the explosion. Cloudant’s BigCouch database let the team keep up with a steady flow of data so it could process and analyze it, then share it with the various stakeholders in near-real-time. The team was changing the data about 20 times per day and writing complex workflows to process it, two tasks that fall into BigCouch’s wheelhouse. The database has a built-in MapReduce engine to enable writing and processing the workflows, and it allows for secondary indices, which users can populate with new data from their MapReduce jobs and query very quickly. Miller actually helped create Cloudant in 2008 while doing post-doctoral research at MIT that involved analyzing huge data sets from CERN’s Large Hadron Collider. Although humans might not be at risk from the Fukushima-based radiation, their scientific experiments might not be so lucky. In an article by the University of Washington’s Office of News and Information, Miller’s colleague R.G. Hamish Robertson explained that the radiation levels “can raise havoc with sensitive physics experiments. That includes one called Majorana, in which the UW physicists are deeply involved, that is being planned for a lab nearly [one] mile down in the proposed Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory in the old Homestake Mine in Lead, S.D.” Miller told me that project, which involves trying to determine what the universe is made of, has been suspended because the next step is to bring highly sensitive homegrown copper up from underground for machining, but that even the trace levels of radiation present in South Dakota could taint it and ruin the experiment. The currently-available paper sharing the team’s results and insights mentions some uncertainty based on questions about the particle sizes they were trying to capture, but Miller said his team has made progress on this front and that they’re “very confident” in the results. The team will release a final paper soon with more detail and a larger time frame of data points.

It's a simple enough metaphor for college basketball, right? Cinderella is a commoner, the story goes, abused and ridiculed by her stepmom and stepsisters on the eve of the royal ball. If not for the unlikely confluence of magic and mice, she has no hope of meeting Prince Charming. In the world of college hoops, you can supplant wicked stepmom with media, evil stepsisters with perennial basketball powerhouses, royal ball with NCAA tournament and Prince Charming with winning the whole shebang. If we're pushing the metaphor, you can also replace mice and magic with suffocating defense and lights-out 3-point shooting. But when is the metaphor misplaced? Ever? Can a team shake the consummate underdog label? How? With Butler and Virginia Commonwealth - neither a stranger to toppling bigs - on tap this weekend, I began researching the Cinderella's origin. I learned the story dates to ninth-century China and the term appears to have been popularized in \"\"Caddyshack\"\" when groundskeeper Carl Spackler (aptly played by Bill Murray) dreams of one day playing in the Masters. Butler returns to home crowd Vasectomy during \"\"March Madness\"\" Basketball dribbler aims for record After an hour of suffering the internet's woefully unhelpful answers, I picked up the phone and called Michael Litos, a marketing consultant and freelance sportswriter but, more importantly, the author of \"\"Cinderella: The Rise of the Mid-Major.\"\" Litos told me he doesn't like the term Cinderella, or the term mid-major - used to describe teams not aligned with one of the major conferences - but he realizes why we need them. By we, he means the media. \"\"I can see the metaphor and I'm fine with it,\"\" he said. \"\"The media need them to kind of put things into boxes. ... What I hope we get past is people being surprised when mid-major teams win ballgames.\"\" I took no offense because ... well, he's right. With Vegas estimating that 100 million people filled out brackets this year, wagering a collective $3 billion on legal and illegal soothsaying, the media are guaranteed a captive audience. At least until VCU or Butler came along and decimated the country's brackets. Read SI.com's complete tourney coverage Before going back to Litos, let me offer a disclaimer: Litos is a Ram, a VCU alumnus. He remembers when his boys toppled Duke in the 2007 tourney. He cringed when ESPN's Hubert Davis said VCU didn't belong in this year's showdown, and he probably smirked when the network's like-minded Jay Bilas tweeted, \"\"Crow: actually, it tastes like chicken.\"\" Litos is also a Colonial Athletic Association buff, so he knows mid-majors. The CAA has produced two of the most compelling Cinderella stories in the last half decade if you count George Mason scrapping its way to a Final Four in 2006. \"\"That's my point, I guess, about the whole Cinderella thing: When they get the chance, they're winning these basketball games,\"\" Litos said. So when does the moniker no longer apply? Do we still consider Gonzaga a Cinderella after it's made every tournament since 1999? Though you could argue VCU still needs to do some resume building, Butler seems to have earned its cred. So what about the Bulldogs? After consecutive Final Four appearances and four Sweet 16s in the last seven years, is Butler still a Cinderella? Read why Butler, VCU make great stories Litos said he believes Gonzaga has fairly shed the title. Cinderellas typically have minuscule basketball budgets (at least compared with the likes of Duke and Kansas); they don't often play on television; they come from conferences that usually lend only one team to the NCAA tournament's field of 64; and they rarely play powerhouses, and then, never at home. Gonzaga has flipped the script and shown that success is cyclical, Litos said. Gonzaga now plays more frequently on television, which means more money, which means better facilities and players, which mean more winning. \"\"Gonzaga just wins,\"\" he explained. \"\"There's a formula in there somewhere. There's just a cycle of success, and it starts with winning basketball games.\"\" Which is exactly what Butler has done in the last two NCAA tournaments, and Litos believes it'll be next to shake off the yoke of underdoggery. \"\"Butler's probably on that precipice now,\"\" he said. \"\"I have a hard time believing that mid-major or Cinderella apply.\"\" Interesting stuff, this, but I know you're thinking it's worthless if I don't tell you how to harness the information for next year's office pool. As this year's CNN.com pool winner (yes, it's already over; we're that bad), I'd love to give you some insight. Here goes: I got lucky as hell with my Richmond and Butler picks. Lacking any thoughts more useful than that, I picked up the phone again - this time for a chat with Ken Pomeroy. The Utah-based meteorologist developed \"\"tempo statistics,\"\" which have earned him respect among many a college basketball coach and analyst, Duke's Mike Krzyzewski and Butler's Brad Stevens among them. He's also a consultant to the Baylor basketball squad. Read why it's easy to hate Duke His site, kenpom.com, focuses less on percentages than it does the pace of the game. Rather than looking at shooting percentage over an entire game or season, for example, he explores play-by-play data and considers how the pace of a game can affect scoring opportunities. Surely, I thought, this master of the quantifiable could give us some pointers on how to determine which underdogs are worth scribbling into our brackets. He flatly stated the opposite: \"\"You're not going to be able to predict the success of an underdog.\"\" Sigh. Pomeroy, for one, is not ready to relieve Butler of its underdog status. He'd like to see more than two stellar performances before making that assessment, he said. As for the VCU Rams, he's not sure their success is totally their doing. Predicting VCU would shine in the tournament would have been difficult. It's shooting better in the tournament than it did during the regular season. It's playing better defense, too, Pomeroy said. \"\"Not to take away anything from what they've done, but teams like Purdue and Kansas played pretty bad games against them,\"\" he said. \"\"How much of it was just Kansas laying an egg? I don't know how you figure that one out.\"\" Few do. Of almost 6 million entrants into ESPN.com's bracket challenge, only two picked the Final Four. Yes, two. Pomeroy told me that, on paper, Kentucky and Butler should meet in the NCAA Final, then, in the next breath, said predictions are silly. But they're fun, and let's be honest, the first two rounds of the tournament wouldn't be as tantalizing without the Cinderellas. They're the reason such a ludicrous percentage of the adult population scrambles to enter pools with friends and co-workers, the reason we monitor scores on our smartphones or head to lunch at the sports bar come tourney time. They're also the reason that dilettantes who pick the winners by team color or mascot ferocity have the same chance as Litos or Pomeroy of winning a pool. The talent gaps between teams, especially in the later rounds, aren't all that disparate so success hinges more on intangibles such as hot streaks and moxie. ' \n",

Of all the volcanic activity on Earth, 75 percent to 80 percent of it takes place at deep-sea ridges in the middle of the oceans. Most of these volcanoes apparently spew out huge volumes of lava instead of erupting explosively, as many volcanoes on land do. It is a high level of gas trapped in a volcano's magma that normally fuels explosive volcanic bursts. This level has long been thought to be low at mid-ocean ridges; moreover, potential undersea explosions would be suppressed by the crushing pressure from the surrounding water. However, based on volcanic ash found at certain sites, geologists have speculated over the last decade that explosive eruptions do take place in deep-sea volcanoes.

But a lesser-known possibility is that life has sprung up on planets that somehow were ejected from their original solar systems and became free-floating in the universe, as well as on small bodies called sub-brown dwarfs, which are stars so small and dim they are not really stars at all, but function more like planets. Studies show these bodies could potentially host atmospheres and surfaces where some form of extraterrestrial life could take hold. Researcher Viorel Badescu of the Polytechnic University of Bucharest in Romania recently investigated the possibilities for life on free-floating planets (FFPs) and sub-brown dwarfs (SBDs) that might contain lakes of the chemical ethane. He found that such life is not impossible, though it would be significantly different from life on Earth. His findings were detailed in the August 2010 issue of the journal Planetary and Space Science. Failed stars Sub-brown dwarfs are not large enough to generate the nuclear fusion that powers normal stars. Having failed as stars, they slowly radiate their internal thermal energy as heat and very dim light - hence, they are extremely hard to detect. Both free-floating planets and sub-brown dwarfs don't always orbit around a parent star, and can be found in interstellar space. Lacking a star, life on FFPs and SBDs would have to rely on the body's internal heat and the decay of radioactive elements for energy. \"\"One may expect a rather stable heat release for long periods of time, exceeding two or three times the present age of the solar system,\"\" said Badescu. Though meager, this heat could be trapped on the object by an optically thick atmosphere. But life needs more than just heat to thrive. Another important ingredient for habitability is a solvent - a liquid environment where important chemical reactions can occur. Life on Earth uses water as a solvent, but that's not the only option. \"\"Synthesis of observational data makes it possible to conceive chemical reactions that might support life involving non-carbon compounds, occurring in solvents other than water,\"\" Badescu wrote in his paper. In particular, Badescu found that ethane - a compound of carbon and hydrogen - could function well as a solvent for alien life. Life without water It seems odd to consider the possibility of life on an object more massive than Jupiter or Saturn, especially since most scientists think such gas giant planets - with their high radiation, hostile atmospheres and potential lack of a planetary surface - would not harbor life as we know it. But Badescu said that some sub-brown dwarfs might have lakes or oceans of liquid ethane that could prove quite homey to alien microbes. The main difference between water and ethane for use as a solvent is that water is a polar molecule, meaning one end of the molecule is positively charged, and one end of it is negatively charged. This has proven integral to Earth life, because the polar properties of water enable certain kinds of molecules to dissolve easily in water, while others remain stable. NASA / JPL-Caltech In this illustration, twin brown dwarfs orbit each other. Despite the name \"\"brown dwarf,\"\" these objects cool and change over time, and therefore do not have a definitive color. The molecules that code for life - DNA and RNA - have electrical charge properties that allow them to change their internal structure - the specific order of the base molecules within them - and still have the same overall physical properties. This is all enabled by the way their charge properties interact with the polar quality of water. That would not be the case with ethane, which is a non-polar molecule. With DNA and RNA in this situation, \"\"small changes in molecular structure may create large changes in molecular behavior,\"\" Badescu said. \"\"That is not acceptable in an encoding biopolymer that must support Darwinian evolution, in which case, the molecule's physical properties must remain relatively constant when the informational content changes.\"\" However, the challenge is not insurmountable - a completely different type of molecule could be used to code life's blueprint on a FFP or SBD. Searching for life Ultimately, free-floating planets and sub-brown dwarfs could prove a fertile place to look for extraterrestrial creatures. Besides their habitable qualities, these bodies seem to be quite common in the universe. Sub-brown dwarfs weighing between 1 and 13 Jupiter masses may be about as common as stars, Badescu said. \"\"The total number of FFPs and SBDs may exceed the number of stars by two orders of magnitude, although most of them should be low-mass rock/ice planetary embryos ejected from planetary systems in formation,\"\" i.e. not the type with large gaseous atmospheres that would retain the heat required for life, Badescu said. \"\"Thus, it might be conceivable that FFPs and SBDs are the most common sites of life in the universe.\"\" ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'The Mars Connection Jeffrey Marlow, a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology, writes from New Mexico, where he is measuring sand particle sizes, layer thicknesses and angles to address questions about volcanoes and rock patterns on Mars. Saturday, March 26 The base surge deposits of Kilbourne Hole and Hunt’s Hole are part of a much larger story, a story that starts on the desolate plains of Mars in 2003. As the Mars Exploration Rover (M.E.R.) Opportunity started surveying its outpost, it found several tantalizing features that pointed to a water-rich history. There was the crossbedding, the salt minerals that seemed to precipitate from an evaporating lake, and the famed \"\"blueberries\"\" — accretionary spherules formed by the movement of water through local rock. But science is all about exhausting every opportunity to prove a theory wrong, and only then accepting it with caveats of probability and likelihood. Many of the devil's advocates pointed to base surge deposits — citing the crossbedding and lapilli spheres — as viable alternatives, suggesting that the sedimentary environment on Mars was volcanic. Lauren Edgar, the doctoral student leading our expedition, also works on the M.E.R. missions, and she recalls: \"\"There was a lot of debate about the origin of the sediment — was it deposited in damp to wet, subaqueous conditions, or was it part of a volcanic base surge deposit like the ones we’re observing at Kilbourne Hole and Hunt’s Hole?\"\" Jeffrey Marlow Volcanic Rocks Just North of the Border Into a Lunar Training Ground Distinguishing between these possibilities has tested the rover's scientific arsenal. \"\"On Earth, we usually have a lot more context, so it’s easier to make these distinctions,\"\" says Lauren. \"\"But on Mars, when you’re dealing with just a small snapshot of the deposit, it can be a lot harder.\"\" Despite the cosmetic similarities, the rover team's consensus at the moment is that water was required to produce some of the sedimentary features that Opportunity has encountered. Nonetheless, it's pretty likely that base surge deposits — volcanic or impact-induced — are abundant on Mars. John Grotzinger is advising Lauren's work with the maar deposits and is the project scientist for the coming Mars Science Laboratory mission. \"\"The early history of Mars was characterized by enormous numbers of bolide impacts that struck the surface of Mars, sending plumes of debris high into the atmosphere\"\" he notes. \"\"As these plumes settled back down to the surface they created base surge deposits.\"\" Thus, establishing a set of criteria to help distinguish base surge sediments from water-based deposits is a critical step in reconstructing ancient Martian environments. As John puts it, \"\"It's important that we be able to distinguish the two, since only subaqueous conditions have strong potential as habitable environments.\"\" One potentially useful marker we've noticed here in New Mexico is the distribution of lapilli — the ashy hailstones that fall out of a cloud of volcanic debris. While the blueberry concretions on Mars are distributed throughout the rock, here the spherules occur only in certain layers, reflecting the periodic, discrete nature of the volcanic hailstorms. Initial results also suggest that the sudden changes in grain size between rock layers and the specific angles of the sedimentary signatures may be additional criteria to help diagnose a base surge deposit. As the sun sets on our final evening and periodic dust devils swirl on the desert plain to the south, I look into the crater and find it easy to imagine myself on Mars. Cue the red filter, cut the vegetation, dial the thermostat back a bit, and you would be hard pressed to tell the two worlds apart. Of course, the differences between the Red and Blue Planets are significant, and with continued sedimentological studies on Mars — and Earth-based analogues like Hunt's Hole and Kilbourne Hole — we should be able to paint a more complete picture of what Mars was like in the past. As with most fieldwork, much of the real work comes back in the lab as samples are processed and photographs are analyzed, but it's clear that base surge deposits produce unique depositional features that will hopefully be resolvable with current and future Mars missions. With samples stowed and a healthy sheen of desert dust covering us, we head back to El Paso, leaving the craters to the coyotes. ' \n",

By Alison McCook NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - New findings add to confusion over whether taking aspirin, ibuprofen or related painkillers reduces the risk of developing melanoma. Animal experiments have suggested that the class of painkillers known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could play a role in preventing melanoma, but a large 2008 study failed to find any evidence to support this possibility. Now, a smaller study that asked people with melanoma and those without the disease to recall their use of NSAIDs has found that taking these drugs - particularly aspirin - at least once a week for more than 5 years may have offered some protection against the deadly disease. The findings are interesting, but should not lead people to conclude that popping a few painkillers will reduce their risk of skin cancer, cautioned Dr. Maryam Asgari of Kaiser Permanente Northern California and the University of California San Francisco, who co-authored the 2008 study. NSAIDs - which include aspirin, naproxen (marketed as Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil) - have side effects, she noted, such as stomach bleeding. People with a family history of melanoma are better off wearing sunscreen and getting regular skin checks from a dermatologist, Asgari recommended. \"\"I think it's just too early\"\" to say NSAIDs offer any protection, she said. \"\"I think the jury is still out.\"\" There's reason to hope NSAIDs might offer some protection against this type of cancer, however - earlier this year, a review found that people who use painkillers such as ibuprofen on a regular basis may be less likely to get bladder cancer. Other research has consistently supported the benefits of NSAIDs in preventing colorectal cancer, and provided some evidence they may work for breast, esophagus, and stomach cancers, as well. Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer, killing almost 9,000 people in the U.S. last year, according to the National Cancer Institute. To investigate whether NSAIDs offer any protection, Dr. Clara Curiel-Lewandrowski of Harvard Medical School and the University of Arizona asked 400 people diagnosed with melanoma and 600 similar people without the disease to recall their use of the painkillers. The researchers found that people without cancer had a longer history of taking NSAIDs than people who eventually developed melanoma. Specifically, more than 40 percent of people who were cancer-free said they'd been taking NSAIDs at least once per week for more than 5 years, versus only 28 percent of those who developed melanoma. Overall, regular use of NSAIDs for more than 5 years appeared to reduce the risk of developing cancer by more than 40 percent, the authors report in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. Unfortunately, the technique - comparing people with melanoma to those without - is fraught with potential problems, said Asgari. For one, you have to get the comparison right, she noted; there's always a concern that people without cancer who agree to participate in the study may be more health conscious to begin with, and it's this that protects them from cancer, not their use of NSAIDs. \"\"Did you somehow get a biased sample of people, and is that why you're seeing this difference?\"\" Her 2008 study analyzed data from nearly 64,000 people who were melanoma-free at the beginning of the investigation, then followed them for a few years to see who developed the disease. She and her colleagues found no evidence that taking NSAIDs had any effect on risk of developing the deadly skin cancer. As a result, \"\"I wouldn't recommend (taking NSAIDs to reduce melanoma) just based on this\"\" new study, Asgari noted. SOURCE: bit.ly/hjf0o1 Journal of Investigative Dermatology, March 10, 2011.

Researchers measured a suite of factors - blood sugar, blood fats, blood pressure, waist size, and body mass - that when elevated add up to \"\"metabolic syndrome,\"\" and found that vegetarians were lower than non-vegetarians on all counts except cholesterol. Having metabolic syndrome puts people at a greater risk of developing diabetes or heart disease in the future. In the study, 23 out of every 100 vegetarians were found to have at least three metabolic syndrome factors, compared with thirty-nine out of every 100 non-vegetarians and 37 out of every 100 semi-vegetarians. \"\"I was expecting there should be a difference,\"\" said Nico Rizzo of Loma Linda University, the lead researcher on the study. \"\"But I didn't expect that it would be that much.\"\" Rizzo and his colleagues analyzed the diet, health and lifestyles of more than 700 adults. Using questionnaires on eating habits, the researchers categorized participants as vegetarians (eating meat of any kind less than once a month), semi-vegetarians (eating meat or poultry less than once a week), and non-vegetarians. The researchers also measured sugar, fat and cholesterol in the subjects' blood as well as blood pressure, waist size, and body mass index (BMI - a measurement of a person's weight relative to height). Vegetarians' average BMI of 25.7 was four points lower than that of non-vegetarians, who, on average, had BMIs close to 30. A BMI greater than 25 is considered overweight, and greater than 30 is considered obese. Semi-vegetarians fell in the middle, with a BMI and waist size smaller than non-vegetarians, but larger than vegetarians. The pattern held when the measurements were combined to determine the presence of metabolic syndrome. Rizzo told Reuters Health he is not sure what's behind the differences. \"\"Is it primarily the meat intake, the plant food intake or a combination of both?\"\" Rizzo said. It's also possible that diet is not the cause; the research showed only an association between food choices and health factors, not cause-and-effect. High BMI, for instance, one of the traits that make up the metabolic syndrome profile, itself contributes to high blood pressure, and indirectly, blood sugar, and thereby potentially raising a person's risk of heart disease and diabetes. The current study, published in the journal Diabetes Care, also did not follow the subjects over the long term to see whether those who abstained from meat actually had lower rates of diabetes or heart disease. The data for this research, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, came from the Adventist Health Study 2, a long term study of Seventh Day Adventists. This religious group has considerably more vegetarians than the general population. In this study, 35 percent of the subjects did not eat meat, whereas only about five percent of all Americans are vegetarian. One of the differences Rizzo discovered between the groups was age. Vegetarians, on average, were 3 years older than the meat-eaters. \"\"Even though they're older, they're in better shape,\"\" Rizzo said. \"\"That's something I found quite interesting.\"\" SOURCE: bit.ly/goHGBG Diabetes Care, online March 16, 2011.

In the Languedoc-Roussillon area, winegrowers from the Pepieux co-operative have been converted, albeit begrudgingly. “Plastic bottles are difficult for me,” said Pascal Fernandez, a winegrower. “In the French culture, a glass bottle with a natural cork is engraved in our genes.” He is among 17 growers who are turning to plastic PET bottles, ready to try anything after an eight-year sales slump that led to thousands of acres of vines in the Aude region being ripped up. One of their top clients, the Hugh Kevin & Robert co-operative, proposed bottling their Greener Planet wine in plastic, starting with an order for 75,000 bottles for Asda in Britain. Asda said a growing number of wine drinkers were shirking heavier, breakable glass in favour of tough, easily resealed, lighter plastic bottles. “We are expecting positive sales over the following weeks, especially as we head towards the summer months and there are more occasions such as outdoor festivals and concerts, where traditional glass wine bottles are banned,” said Lottie Parsons, a spokesman for Asda. Britons consume about one billion bottles of wine each year. PET wine bottles are now a familiar sight everywhere from Glastonbury to the Henley Regatta. Philippe Lauret, the president of Les Celliers Jean d’Alibert, which sells Mr Fernandez’s wine, said his firm expected to supply Asda with 360,000 bottles of wine in plastic bottles this year. Even the French are forgoing glass and cork when it comes to lower-grade wines. Last year Auguste Bonlouis sold more than three million plastic bottles to French supermarkets, a restaurant chain and the retailer Monoprix. However, shunning glass has appalled some purists. When the Boisset Family Estates switched to PET-bottled Beaujolais Nouveau in Japan, Canada and America, producers revolted. Such was the outcry that the Beaujolais winegrowers union has since banned bottling their wine, including Nouveau Beaujolais, in plastic. Meanwhile, high-end wine growers look down their noses at PET as totally unsuitable for wines destined for cellars, because the plastic is porous, allowing the wines to oxidise much faster than glass. “It is absolutely unusable for wines destined to be kept between three and 40 years, as is the case for ours,” said Patrick Maroteaux, whose Chateau Branaire-Ducru is a highly sought-after grand vin from the St Julien appellation.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'The Geoid: Why a map of Earth's gravity yields a potato-shaped planet This video is no April's fool joke: Earth really is shaped like a potato. However, the shape that you see here is, um, slightly exaggerated to highlight its irregularities. Another caveat: what is depicted here is not the shape of the planet, but rather the shape of an idealized sea-level surface extending around the entire globe—a surface that Earth scientists call the geoid. The video is the most accurate reconstruction of the geoid to date, and was released by the European Space Agency at a scientific meeting in Munich on March 31 (see a video of the related press conference here). It is based on data collected by ESA's Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE). The five-meter long, arrowhead-shaped probe has been in a low orbit for almost exactly two years, collecting painstakingly accurate measurements of the gravitational field of Earth. Alas, many of the Web sites and blogs that reported on GOCE's results so far got it wrong. Contrary to what was stated in these reports, the geoid is not a surface on which the strength of gravity is the same at every point. The geoid is, in the words of an oceanographer on the GOCE team, a surface such that if you placed a marble anywhere on it, it would stay there rather than rolling in any direction. Another way of saying it is, imagine you were an engineer traveling around the world with a level. Then wherever you go, the level would be exactly parallel to the geoid at that place. Yet another equivalent definition: it is a surface that's everywhere perpendicular to the direction of a plumb-bob, or in other words, to the gravitational field. Gravity need not have the same strength everywhere on the geoid. In other words, if you could walk on the geoid you would see gravity always pointing exactly downwards, but your weight could slightly change from one region to another. The misunderstanding may have stemmed from the confusion of two concepts from multivariable calculus: a vector field and its potential. The vector field in this case is the gravity field, and the potential is the gravitational potential (which is essentially the gravitational energy of a unit mass). At any point in space, the gravity field can be seen as the direction in which the gravitational potential rises fastest. Its magnitude, or length, is the rate of change of the potential. The field defined this way is called the gradient vector field of the potential. In general, the gradient of a quantity defined in space is the 3-D version of the derivative of a quantity in the sense of single-variable calculus. (To be pedantic: for historical reasons, the gravity field is defined to be the opposite vector to the gradient of the potential.) If you were to follow a gravitational field line—a curve which is at every point tangent to the vector field at that point—you would follow a curve of steepest ascent on the gravitational potential. That's why it is called the gradient. (Note that because of inertia, the field lines of the gravitational field are not necessarily the trajectories of a body in free fall. The field won't tell you in which direction you'll be moving—only in which direction you will accelerate .) Gradient vector fields are difficult to grasp in 3-D, because picturing the potential (to visualize the ascent or descent) would require a fourth dimension. But a 2-D analogy might help. Think of how water trickles down a hilly surface. Neglecting inertia, a droplet of water would follow a curve of steepest descent, which is a vector field made of vectors along the surface. In this analogy, the elevation of the droplet is the analogue of the potential at that point. And the analogue of the geoid is an elevation contour on a topographical map: the potential—the height—is constant along the contour. Obviously, some parts of this contour can be on steep terrain, whereas others can be on mild gradients. (On a topographical map, the slope is steeper where many different contour lines are crowded together.) The magnitude of the gradient vector field—which represents the steepness of a slope—is not the same at all points of the contour. Thus, gravity does change in strength along the geoid, and so the geoid is not \"\"a shape where the gravity is the same no matter where you stood on it,\"\" as one blogger put it. Nor is it \"\"how the Earth would look like if its shape were distorted to make gravity the same everywhere on its surface,\"\" as reported by a major news site, which went on to add that \"\"areas of strongest gravity are in yellow and weakest in blue,\"\" apparently not noticing the contradiction with the previous sentence. There are many reasons why the geoid isn't a sphere. First and foremost, the Earth itself isn't a sphere. It is closer to an ellipsoid, being flattened at the poles by the centrifugal force of its own rotation. But the planet isn't an ellipsoid either, because of topography. Mountains and valleys are asymmetrical distributions of mass. That mass distribution affects the gravitational field and makes the geoid asymmetrical too. Then there is Earth's inner and outer structure. The oceanic crust and the landmasses of the continental shelves are made of different materials that have different densities; and farther down, the mantle is not uniform either, with regions that have slightly different compositions and temperatures, and thus slightly different densities. \"\"The variations,\"\" Reiner Rummel, a senior GOCE scientist, told me in an email, \"\"reflect processes in the deep earth mantle such as descending tectonic plates and hot mantle plumes.\"\" All of which affects the strength of the gravitational field, and the GOCE's orbit. The probe measures these effects thus it measures the gravitational field. The geoid is not to be confused with anomalies due to the topography of the land – although it is affected in part by it. Also—and here is where things get really tricky—it is not to be confused with the actual sea level. Wait a minute, you say, but isn't the ocean supposed to be at sea level by definition? Except for relatively small perturbations such as waves or tides, you say, shouldn't the surface be exactly horizontal (that is, perpendicular to the gravitational field) everywhere? Isn't that, after all, what \"\"sea level\"\" means? Yes, to some approximation. However, the oceans are not homogenous. Differences of salinity and temperature make them more or less dense. Moreover, the Earth's rotation produces forces that keep the oceans in constant motion. Just like the water in a river is not all at the same level—after all, it flows to the sea for a reason—the water in the ocean also has differences in height. And by height, it should be clear by now, I mean elevation relative to the geoid, which can be positive or negative. Oceanographers thus speak of the \"\"topography\"\" of the ocean, meaning that it really has hills and valleys. In fact, here is where the \"\"ocean circulation\"\" part of GOCE's name comes into play: one of the main goals of the mission is to measure the oceans' topography and from that deduce the structure of the oceanic currents. The deviations of the geoid from the simplified, ellipsoidal model of the Earth are substantial: they range from 100 meters below (dark blue in the video) to 80 meters above (yellow), Rummel says. The surface in the video is the geoid amplified by a factor 7,000, says GOCE mission manager Rune Floberghagen. ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'The Amazing Disappearing Neutrino By Eugenie Samuel Reich of Nature magazine Neutrinos have long perplexed physicists with their uncanny ability to evade detection, with as many as two-thirds of the ghostly particles apparently going missing en route from the Sun to Earth. Now a refined version of an old calculation is causing a stir by suggesting that researchers have also systematically underestimated the number of the particles' antimatter partners - antineutrinos - produced by nuclear reactor experiments. The deficit could be caused by the antineutrinos turning into so-called 'sterile antineutrinos', which can't be directly detected, and which would be clear evidence for effects beyond the standard model of particle physics. In the 1960s, physicist Ray Davis, working deep underground in the Homestake gold mine in South Dakota, found that the flux of solar neutrinos hitting Earth was a third of that predicted by calculations of the nuclear reactions in the Sun by theorist John Bahcall. Davis later received a Nobel prize for his contributions to neutrino astrophysics. That puzzle was considered solved in 2001, when the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in Canada found the missing two-thirds through an alternative means of detection. The SNO's results were taken as evidence that neutrinos have a mass, which allows them to oscillate between three flavors: electron, muon and tau. Davis had only detected the electron neutrinos. Experiments that measure the rate of antineutrino production from the decay of uranium and plutonium isotopes have so far produced results roughly consistent with this theory. But the revised calculation accepted this week by Physical Review D suggests that it's not the whole story. While waiting for the Double Chooz neutrino experiment in France to become fully operational, Thierry Lasserre and his colleagues at the French atomic energy commission(CEA) in Saclay set out to check predictions of the rate of antineutrino production by nuclear reactors. They repeated a calculation first done in the 1980s by Klaus Schreckenbach at the Technical University of Munich, using more modern techniques that allowed them to be much more precise. Their new estimate of the rate of production is around 3% more than previously predicted. This means that several generations of neutrino and antineutrino experiments have unknowingly missed a small fraction of the particles. \"\"It was completely a surprise for us,\"\" says Lasserre. Double Chooz consists of two detectors measuring the flux of antineutrinos produced by the Chooz nuclear power plant in the French Ardennes, one detector about 400 meters away from the plant and the other 1 kilometer away. The far detector became operational this year. Stefan Schönert, a neutrino physicist at the Technical University of Munich, says the calculation is solid, and has been checked with Schreckenbach. \"\"They can reproduce each other's results. There's no way around this result. It's very solid.\"\" Art McDonald of Queen's University in Kingston, Canada and the SNO says that people have to look carefully at the calculation, which may itself have a systematic error. But, he adds, \"\"there's no doubt it would have significance as a physics result if it can be shown with more accuracy.\"\" The result may be pointing to evidence of neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillating into a fourth kind of neutrino or antineutrino, a so-called 'sterile' version that doesn't interact with ordinary matter, says Carlo Giunti, a physicist at the University of Turin in Italy. Other experiments have previously seen evidence for sterile particles, including the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Mini Booster Neutrino Experiment, or MiniBooNE, at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, and the search to confirm their existence is a hot area of physics. Giunti says that the magnitude of the anomaly uncovered by Lasserre is not statistically significant on its own, but that it points promisingly in the same direction as another anomaly found by the SAGE collaboration, which studied neutrinos from a radioactive source at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in the Caucasus in 2005. \"\"Before this, there used to be a contradiction between [reactor and radioactive source] experiments but now they are in agreement,\"\" says Giunti. Schönert says that one key experiment everyone is waiting for is a measurement showing that the rate of disappearance of antineutrinos from a source increases with the distance from it. \"\"This would be the smoking gun,\"\" he says.

Dave Attwood has spent the past four months pondering such matters. Given that he has got a degree in physics and philosophy from Bristol University he is well equipped to get his head around delicate issues. Attwood has had plenty on which to reflect, notably the fallout from a stamping incident in December against La Rochelle that led to a nine-week suspension. In its wake came demotion from the England senior squad, putting in jeopardy an international career that had barely begun. It had all looked so rosy: a summer tour to Australia last season, two caps from the bench in November and promise of things to come. And now? The World Cup is a remote prospect, all the more so given that Attwood is struggling to even get a start with Gloucester. He has managed 86 minutes playing time since the New Year. On Saturday afternoon he again has to make do with a place on the bench against Newcastle. Attwood is a chastened man, acknowledging that a bad-boy reputation was starting to take shape. He was cited for stamping on tour to Australia only for the case to be dismissed on a technicality. “It was reckless, petulant and daft,” says Attwood, of the La Rochelle incident. “It was a very unfortunate episode, one that has put a brake on everything.” At the time, Attwood was not fully aware of what had happened, although the fact that “a bunch of Frenchies spent the best part of an hour swinging punches told me that I’d done something”. He had. In the 15th minute of the Amlin Challenge Cup game against La Rochelle at Kingsholm, Attwood’s boot came down on the face of the opposition’s Romanian prop, Petrisor Toderasc. He had been tugged back by Toderasc and had struck out. Toderasc was taken to Gloucester Royal Infirmary that Sunday night but was released following treatment for broken teeth, cheekbone damage and cuts. Two days later reports from France suggested that Toderasc’s sight was in danger. “That Tuesday night was a pretty dark time for me,” Attwood says. “It was quite horrifying to think that someone might lose their sight. I don’t play rugby to go out to hurt people. \"\"I’m not a malicious bloke or a nasty player. I don’t want to be known as an enforcer.” Toderasc had not been blinded but Attwood was cited and banned for nine weeks. In January he was left out of England’s Elite Player Squad. The punishment was salutary and far-reaching. “It was completely my fault and I got what I deserved,” Attwood says candidly. “I’ve borne the brunt of it. Nine weeks has turned into 16 weeks. Yes, I have learnt a lesson from it. I’ve tarnished my reputation and I’ve got to work hard to recover that.” Attwood has come to realise that top-end rugby simply does not tolerate foul play. “I was brought up playing rugby in Bristol, where you took your medicine,” Attwood says. “I always knew that you weren’t allowed to do things but there would always be a ‘but’ in my mind. There isn’t any more. \"\"You simply can’t take the law into your own hands. It’s been difficult to get to grips with that, to get that blueprint in your mind. I’m more reflective now, more aware. You do have to turn the other cheek. “I’ve got to ensure that it doesn’t happen again. Of course in my position you’ve got to be aggressive and not take a backward step. But the game at this level is about power, performance and physicality. That’s how you really leave your mark. That’s what being a hard man means.” Attwood is an engaging character, articulate, honest, forthright and self-aware. He realises that his England prospects are bleak. “It would be foolish not to admit that I’ve significantly damaged my chances,” he says. “ It will be nigh on impossible now to squeeze back in. I’m resigned to that fact. England is not a realistic ambition at the moment. Doing all that I can for Gloucester is.” And that will not be for much longer. Attwood, 24 on Tuesday, has signed for West Country rivals Bath for next season. He does not believe that his lack of starting opportunities for Gloucester is anything to do with the fact that he is moving on. “I haven’t been frozen out at all, more that Gloucester have had a great run of form,” said Attwood, noting ruefully that his only start was in the 53-15 defeat by Harlequins last weekend. “That was a humping. Time is running out here and I owe Gloucester a massive amount. Moving to Bath was a very difficult decision. But [Gloucester owner] Tom Walkinshaw’s passing in December put contract talks on hold. \"\"Bath came in with an incredibly attractive offer. I can understand talk about loyalty and all that but it was about providing for my future.” England are still keeping a close eye on Attwood. He might yet get his chance in the Churchill Cup in June. They welcome the fact that he has got a bit of edge to him. “There have been no conversations with England about changing my ways,” Attwood says. “I guess they feel I’m bright enough to take it all on board.” It has been a formative year in the life of Attwood, rising from relative obscurity to win England honours. In hindsight, that was the easy bit. As Attwood comes to terms with taxing realities, you fancy the philosophy element of his degree will prove useful. “I’ve got to show that I’ve got the character to cope with all this,” Attwood says. “And that’s exactly what I intend to do.” ' \n",

But the space agency's contributions to people's everyday lives here on Earth still run wide and deep. NASA's primary charter is to explore and better understand the cosmos. But much of the technology NASA developed in reaching for the stars has filtered down to the masses, leading to innovations such as more nutritious infant formula and sunglasses that block harmful ultraviolet light. \"\"We get better airplanes, or we get better weather forecasting from space stuff, sure,\"\" said Daniel Lockney, program executive in technology transfer and spinoff partnerships at NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C. \"\"But we also get better-fed children. That kind of stuff, people don't necessarily associate.\"\" Some of the highlights Some of the technologies most closely associated with NASA were utilized - and in some cases popularized - by the space agency rather than invented by its scientists. There's the orange-flavored drink Tang, for instance, which was developed by General Foods in 1957. Or Velcro, a Swiss invention from the 1940s. Or Teflon, a synthetic polymer that has found widespread use as an industrial lubricant and a nonstick coating for pots and pans. \"\"Teflon we get all the time,\"\" Lockney told Space.com. \"\"But that was DuPont.\"\" But the list of NASA inventions that have benefited the public is long and storied. There's \"\" memory foam,\"\" for example, which today pads the helmets of football players and is used to manufacture prosthetic limbs. NASA scientists invented the substance in 1966 to make airplane seats safer and more comfortable. NASA research investigating the nutritional value of algae led to the discovery of a nutrient that had previously been found only in human breast milk. The compound, which is thought to be important to eye and brain development, has since found its way into 95 percent of the infant formula sold in the United States, Lockney said. There are many more. NASA research led to the development of sunglasses that block damaging blue and ultraviolet light, for example. One-third of all cell phone cameras use technology originally developed for NASA spacecraft. And in the 1960s, NASA scientists who wanted to enhance pictures of the moon invented digital image processing. The technology later found many other applications - particularly in the medical field, where it helped enable body-imaging techniques such as CAT scans and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A secondary benefit Since 1976, NASA has been publishing a magazine called \"\"Spinoff\"\" that describes some of the technologies that have found their way into ordinary folks' lives. \"\"Spinoff\"\" has detailed 1,723 such inventions to date, Lockney said - and that list is far from exhaustive. \"\"We've got a very limited page count,\"\" Lockney said. \"\"So there's stuff that doesn't get put in the book.\"\" ' \n",

Demographer Cassandra Dorius, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research in Ann Arbor, analyzed data on nearly 4,000 U.S. women who were interviewed more than 20 times over a period of 27 years. The data included information about individual men in each household, describing what demographers call \"\"relationship churning.\"\" Dorius found multiple fathers is common - 28 percent of all U.S. women with two or more children have children by more than one man - and it is frequently tied to marriage and divorce rather than just single parenthood. \"\"We tend to think of women with multiple partner fertility as being only poor single women with little education and money, but in fact at some point, most were married and working, and going to school and doing all the things you're supposed to do to live the American Dream,\"\" Dorius says in a statement.

Marie-Soleil Beaudoin, a doctoral student at the University of Guelph in Ontario, with Professors Lindsay Robinson and Terry Graham, discovered not only that a healthy person's blood-sugar level spikes after eating a high-fat meal, and it doubles if caffeinated coffee is added - jumping to levels similar to those of people at risk for diabetes. In the study, healthy men drank about 1 gram of a fat-laden beverage - a fat cocktail that contains only lipids - for every kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight. Six hours later, they were given a sugar drink. When people eat sugar, the body produces insulin, which takes the sugar out of the blood and distributes it to our muscles, Beaudoin explains. The study, published in the Journal of Nutrition, found that the fatty meal affected the body's ability to clear the sugar out of the blood - blood-sugar levels were 32 percent higher than they were when the men had not ingested the fat cocktail. However, after they received two cups of caffeinated coffee 5 hours after ingesting the fat beverage and later a sugar drink - blood-sugar levels increased by 65 percent. ' \n",

Now a major new report says it's time to study the unique health needs of gay and transgender people, too. Stigma often keeps lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from seeking health care - and when they do, there's little research to guide doctors in their treatment, the Institute of Medicine reported Thursday. Changing that starts with a seemingly simple step: Researchers should start asking people about their sexual orientation and gender identity in all government-funded health studies, the panel said. The report is intended as technical advice to the National Institutes of Health. But to the gay-rights community, the recommendations from such a prestigious scientific group promise to legitimize a quest for greater health equality. \"\"This community is just ignored,\"\" said Brian Moulton of the Human Rights Campaign. \"\"This is going to spark a long-term commitment to dealing with these issues.\"\" The chairman of the report, however, anticipates some political criticism. \"\"This is a scientific report, not an advocacy report,\"\" said Dr. Robert Graham, professor of family medicine at the University of Cincinnati. \"\"Whatever your politics, as long as you accept the premise that every American ought to have the opportunity for the same health status and the same degree of health, then you really have to understand what the different influences are that may keep certain populations away from having that opportunity.\"\" The IOM panel couldn't even find a good estimate of how many people identify themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. It stressed that these are separate populations that require separate assessments of their needs at different ages. California is one of the few states where researchers collect data on LGBT issues. Last week, the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research reported that older gays, lesbians and bisexuals are more prone to high blood pressure and psychological distress than heterosexuals. Moreover, they are more likely to live alone, without children or partners to provide care and support. Nationally, what is known? The AIDS virus remains a threat to young men, particularly black men, who have sex with men, the report noted. But the IOM panel also identified far broader issues: Increased risks of depression, suicide attempts, homelessness and being victims of violence. Possibly higher rates of smoking and substance use. Lesbians and bisexual women may get less preventive care and have higher rates of obesity and breast cancer. In addition, laws barring same-sex marriage often limit access to health insurance, and there are few health providers trained to treat transgender patients in particular in a culturally competent manner, the report said.

      "Warning! Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Richard Feynman, the Thinker In the heyday of the physicist Richard P. Feynman, which ensued after his death in 1988, a publishing entrepreneur might have been tempted to start a book club of works by and about him. Offered as main selections would be Feynman’s autobiographical rambles (as told to Ralph Leighton), “ ‘Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!’ ” and “ ‘What Do You Care What Other People Think?’ ” For alternate selections, readers could choose from his more serious works, like “QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter” — a spirited account of the counterintuitive behavior of the quantum world — and the legendary “Feynman Lectures on Physics.” Whatever the man said had swagger. For those who would rather listen, there are recordings of the lectures and of Feynman playing his bongos. He was an irresistible subject for biographers and, as he called himself in two of his subtitles, a curious character indeed. The best biography, James Gleick’s “Gen­ius,” captured the ebullience — sometimes winning, sometimes exasperating — and gave lucid explanations of some hard physics. Those seeking a more mathematical treatment could turn to Jagdish Mehra’s thick book “The Beat of a Different Drum,” while for a lighter touch there was Christopher Sykes’s “No Ordinary Gen­ius: The Illustrated Richard Feynman.” It is hard to imagine that the world needs another Feynman biography, but here it is. In “Quantum Man: Richard Feynman’s Life in Science,” Lawrence M. Krauss, director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University, makes his own way through the subject and emerges with an enlightening addition to the field. Krauss — like Feynman a physicist as well as an author — has written seven books, including “The Physics of Star Trek.” Though he couldn’t resist recycling some well-worn Feynman anecdotes (and providing a couple of his own), he concentrates on Feynman the thinker, and on the contributions that merited his fame. It is not something easily summarized. Einstein discovered relativity. Murray Gell-Mann discovered the quark. And Feynman? Well, there was that thing he did on TV with the O-ring and the ice water, showing why the Challenger had disintegrated. But to physicists he is famous for something more obscure: cleaning up the mathematical mess known as quantum electrodynamics — an ambitious attempt to explain light and matter using two great theories, quantum mechanics and special relativity. In 1965, he shared a Nobel Prize with two colleagues (Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga), who solved the problem in different ways. But Feynman’s “sum over paths” approach, expressed in the lines and squiggles of what became known as Feynman diagrams, opened up a more intuitive understanding of the subatomic realm. It was, as Krauss puts it, “a beautiful pictorial way of thinking about quantum mechanics.” Other good books give a feel for this and Feynman’s later accomplishments. But I understood it all better after watching over the shoulder of Krauss the physicist as he worked his way through the Feynman oeuvre — not the stories of fast times in Rio, but the scientific papers. In popular lore, Feynman often comes off as the wild man of physics, throwing out one crazy idea after another in a frenzied search for truth. In “Quantum Man” — part of the “Great Discoveries” series, for which I have also written a book — we see more of his other side: a master mathematician who could concentrate on a problem for hours and then recast it in a surprising new manner. In following the chain of ideas that led to Feynman’s Nobel, Krauss begins with a familiar phenomenon — the way a light ray takes a sudden bend when it enters a pool of water. The angle can be calculated using a staple of high school physics called Snell’s law, but in the 17th century Pierre de Fermat provided a deeper explanation: the light beam acts as though it were trying to minimize its total travel time. Light moves more slowly in water than in air, so it adjusts its course, ensuring that it spends no longer than necessary in the denser medium. The idea is not that the light beam is thinking ahead but that the universe is somehow structured so it appears that way. During the next century, mathematicians showed that Newton’s laws of motion could be rewritten in a similar vein: an orbiting planet or a hurtling cannonball moves as though it were trying to minimize a more abstract quantity called “action.” Krauss gives readers a feel for what that means and shows how Feynman retooled the idea to solve some nagging problems in subatomic physics. One of science’s great puzzles (still only partly solved) is how to reconcile the regularities of classical physics — like the bending light beam — with the probabilistic laws of quantum mechanics. Light, after all, consists of photons, which are capable of doing all kinds of strange things. In moving from A to B, a photon may take any number of different paths, even ones that seem absurd — spiraling in curlicues, changing speeds in midair. With Feynman’s method, these acrobatics can be added together, the weirdest ones canceling one another out, to yield the motion we observe in the familiar world. This triumph came early in his career. His later thinking (about solid-state physics, for example, or quantum cosmology) was just as original. Maybe sometimes too original, Krauss suggests. Science usually proceeds by building on what came before. The maverick in Feynman kept him from accepting even the most established ideas until he had torn them apart and reassembled the pieces. That led to a deeper understanding, but his time might have been better spent at the cutting edge. “He continued to push physics forward as few modern scientists have,” Krauss writes, “but he tended to lead from the rear or, at best, from a side flank.” Like those quantum particles, he seemed eager to try every path — even the crazy ones. That was true in his life as well as in his physics.

Federal scientists say they have dated coral living near the site of the busted BP oil well in the Gulf of Mexico at 2,000 years old. The U.S. Geological Survey said Wednesday it had determined the age of the black coral in the Gulf for the first time. Scientists had been studying the ancient slow-growing corals before BP's well blew out on April 20, 2010. The corals were found about 21 miles (34 kilometers) northeast of the BP well living 1,000 feet (305 meters) below the surface of the Gulf. \"\"They're extremely old and extremely slow-growing,\"\" said Nancy Prouty, a USGS scientist. \"\"And there are big questions about their vulnerability and their ability for recovery.\"\" Black corals feed on organic matter sinking to the sea floor and it could take decades, or even centuries, to recover from \"\"a disturbance to these ecosystems,\"\" Prouty said. She said scientists were looking at whether the ancient coral had been damaged by the BP oil spill, but the damage assessment had not been completed. The location of the black coral is important because computer models and research cruises have mapped much of the deepwater oil moving to the southwest of the BP well, away from the black coral colony. Scientists have found dead coral southwest of the well. However, Prouty said the surface oil slick was over the black coral colony during the spill. BP's well leaked more than 200 million gallons (757 million liters) of oil after the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded April 20, killing 11 workers. Black corals, which resemble deep-sea bushes or trees, are found throughout the world and are an important marine habitat for fish and other forms of marine life. They grow very slowly - a human fingernail grows 2,000 times faster than black coral, USGS said. Most of the Gulf's bottom is muddy and the coral colonies that pop up every once in a while are vital oases for marine life in the chilly ocean depths. The USGS study was part of a larger federal survey of fragile reef ecosystems. ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Toxins in baby food might affect hormones: study NEW YORK - Infant formula and solid baby food frequently contain fungus-derived hormones that have been shown to cause infertility in mammals, Italian researchers report. Scientists at the University of Pisa report that as many as 28% of samples of milk-based baby formulas they tested were contaminated with the fungal hormones, known as mycoestrogens. They tested 185 formula samples and 44 samples of meat-based baby food from a total of 21 brands commonly sold in Italy. The substances detected in the baby products included zearalenone and its derivatives, which comes from Fusarium, a large family of fungi common in farm settings. Although zearalenone and related chemicals that resemble the hormone estrogen have been linked to infertility in mammals, especially pigs, it's not clear whether babies exposed to the compounds through food or formula would be at risk for any reproductive problems later in life. Previous research has shown that the body rapidly breaks down zearalenone into byproducts that pose no health threat. Still, the Italian researchers say their findings merit follow-up and ought to prompt closer scrutiny of baby formula and baby foods for the presence of these and other toxins. \"\"Our study shows the presence of mycoestrogens in infant food,\"\" Francesco Massart, who led the study, told Reuters Health. \"\"This is likely to have greater implications for infants and young children than for adults having a more varied diet.\"\" Mycoestrogens such as zearalenone are a fact of life for commercial agriculture. They are present in crops like corn, wheat and soy that are used for both human consumption and animal feed. Cattle yards in the United States regularly use one such substance, alpha-zeralanol, as a growth stimulant for the animals, although the European Union banned this practice in the mid-1980s. The Italian group sought to determine whether zearalenone and similar chemicals might be making their way into infant foods. The answer proved to be yes. Massart and his colleagues analyzed 185 samples from 14 brands of infant formula containing cow's milk. They also tested 44 samples of baby foods, from seven brands, containing beef, chicken, turkey, calf, horse, rabbit, ham and lamb. Zearalenone appeared in 17 (9%) of the formula samples, and two derivatives of the molecule, alpha- and beta-zeralenol, were present in about a quarter of the samples. Among the meat-based baby foods, only the alpha- and beta-zeralenol derivatives were present in a less than a quarter of the samples. Concentrations of mycoestrogens varied widely but in general, the levels detected were well below the World Health Organization's provisional maximum tolerable daily intake of 0.5 micrograms per kilogram of body weight. Average concentrations of beta-zeralenol in infant formula were four times the recommended maximum, however. Although Massart acknowledged that many questions remain about the possible link between mycoestrogens and harm to humans, he said the findings should give pause to parents who use baby formula. \"\"Children, and in particular preterm newborns, are potentially exposed to higher dose of mycotoxins during their early phases of life, but no one knows the long-term effects,\"\" he said. Animal research and the few available human studies suggest the early mycotoxin exposures may affect human health, Massart noted. \"\"Specific studies should be initiated that allow the establishment of safe levels of zearalenone metabolites in feed materials and compounded feeds, particularly for infants and children of different ages, as they are considered to be the most sensitive to environmental chemicals.\"\" Gilbert Ross, a physician and medical director of the American Council on Science and Health, a New York-based advocacy group, disagreed. \"\"Detecting something in food does not mean it's harmful,\"\" Ross said. \"\"Further, the detection methods found (the contaminants) but at levels far too low to affect human health, including that of babies. As the authors themselves point out, the presence of these substances in food products are of \"\"little significance\"\" because the body rapidly breaks them down and excretes them,\"\" Ross said.

But he might just be sick with worry about us. If a team of respected scientific researchers is right, religious belief is headed for extinction in at least nine nations. This projection, somber to some and soothing to others, got a lot of play during the recent annual meeting in Dallas of the American Physical Society. First reported by the BBC, the findings came in the form of a highly technical account of group dynamics based on a mathematical model. They would spark little public interest if the subject were bowling leagues or bocce enthusiasts. Religion, to put it mildly, is different. A fair historian would acknowledge that faith has been on trial since the beginning. The centuries have seen intense, sometimes violent, conflicts among competing creeds. But the most intense conflicts of the 20th century weren't among groups of religious believers, but among political cultures that believed human rights to be of divine origin and others that placed their trust in a state that bowed to no God. States founded on the divine authorship of human dignity and freedom waged defensive struggles against the claims of officially atheistic ideologies such as communism and Nazism. Marx framed his ideology as a permanent end-point of human development in which religion, the opiate of the masses, at last had been destroyed. Hitler envisioned a 1,000-year reich of Aryan supremacy through which the altars of Europe would be stripped of their Bibles and crowned with his racist manifesto, \"\"Mein Kampf.\"\" Western democracies were slow to awaken to the implications, responding only when their own survival was threatened. The abiding faith of Americans, of Britons and free French, of the entire Western enterprise, rose to the surface in these circumstances. At the end of World War II, the people of Great Britain seemed to stand as one to hear \"\"A Song of Thanksgiving,\"\" composer Ralph Vaughan Williams' stirring choral prayer celebrating the defeat of Hitler. The libretto deployed verses from Isaiah - \"\"they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations\"\" - to summon a war-torn nation to recovery. Existential threats still have that effect on populaces with a national memory of faith. Remember the fullness of America's churches in the months after 9/11? A profound sense of peril sharpens the spiritual sense, or at least spurs the spiritual search. But the faith that springs up in the dust of calamity may be dispersed in the breezes of better times or the whirlwinds of scientific atheism. The excesses of religion also fuel the revival of cynicism. Scandals of money and sex dispirit millions and destroy entire congregations. The \"\"religious\"\" motivations of today's worst terrorists provide fodder to celebrity intellectuals anxious to promote the idea that religion itself is the enemy of, and not the answer to, the highest aspirations of humanity. Mao and Stalin certainly disprove that idea. Monstrous deeds come in garb both sacred and secular. So are the researchers with their math model right? Is religious belief on the rocks? Strictly speaking, they examined a grand total of nine countries, mostly European. The decline in church attendance there is well documented. But religious tides roam worldwide, and demographics - adherents bearing adherents - still matter. Islam is growing and so are Mormonism and Pentecostalism. What about the United States? Despite all the noise about surging atheism, more than 60 percent of Americans do not doubt the existence of God. Almost 40 percent frequently attend church. Even with an increase in those who decline to affiliate with a particular faith, the majority of us hold to some religious belief. It's also debatable whether those claiming \"\"none\"\" on surveys of religious affiliation actually are irreligious. The Pew Religious Landscape Survey for 2007 found that about 16 percent of the U.S. population was nonaffiliated. But only a quarter were either atheists or agnostics. Half of the remainder said religion was either somewhat or very important to them. Perhaps brick-and-mortar churchgoing is in decline, while individual spirituality is not. In such an environment, the future is volatile. Churches that are lax on self-policing might reform. Personal faith may seek sustenance in community. And, as tsunamis and Middle East uprisings remind us, existential threats may arrive at any time. Mathematicians who bring special talents to quantum mechanics can't take us any further than others in the quest for meaning. People are not particles. Heaven's heartaches begin when we act otherwise. Each Saturday the Daily News offers men and women of faith the opportunity to share their words of life and comfort with our readers.

Further trials have yet to be carried out but if they are successful it is hoped the principle can be applied to treat hay fever sufferers and people with other allergies. The research was carried out by Circassia, a biotechnology company based in Oxford, and the McMaster University in Ontario, Canada. Steve Harris, chief executive of Circassia, said that the results are \"\"extremely good news\"\". \"\"By achieving a significant reduction in symptoms after just four doses, whilst also proving extremely well tolerated, our novel T-cell vaccine has demonstrated the true potential of ToleroMunie to revolutionise allergy treatment.\"\" In the past, regular allergy shots have been considered to be the best way to treat allergies but that is difficult and expensive. Professor Mark Larché's findings were published in the Journal of Allergy & Clinical Immunology.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Why we must make the adder count More research into adder genetics may prevent small isolated colonies from dying out One of only six reptile species native to Britain, the adder is a fussy creature. Its restriction to specific habitats, and its frequent disturbance by human activity, well-meaning and otherwise, have made its populations isolated and prone to the effects of inbreeding. The Institute of Zoology, Natural England and Oxford University is undertaking a survey of adders (also known as vipers) to identify whether their population in the UK is suffering from a lack of genetic diversity. This is encouraging, and I fully support further research into adder genetics. Two of the other reptile species in Britain, the sand lizard and smooth snake, have always had limited natural ranges here. Because of this, they have strict legal protection and have been the subject of conservation programmes to protect and manage the few sites where they occur, and to reintroduce them to places from where they have disappeared. The adder is one of the remaining four species that we call \"\"widespread\"\" because they have much larger natural ranges in Britain. The adder can be found from the very south-west of England all the way north to Scotland. This does not mean that Britain is brimming with them or any other reptile species: within their apparently large ranges, they are restricted to certain types of habitat. The adder prefers grassland, scrub and woodland edge, primarily on sandy soils. There are also other factors that make it a particularly vulnerable species. Back in 2004, English Nature (now Natural England) contacted naturalists around the country who had good knowledge of adder populations and asked them to evaluate the health of \"\"their\"\" adders, with some interesting results. In their opinion, \"\"disturbance\"\" was the greatest threat. But analysis of the data revealed some other trends. A third of the adder populations were small (estimated as fewer than 10 adult snakes), and more than a third of the populations were isolated. Population declines tended to be more frequent among these small or isolated populations, as is to be expected due to chance fluctuations, but also as you would expect from inbreeding. Amphibian and Reptile Conservation co-ordinates Make the Adder Count, a project encouraging local adder conservation and long-term monitoring of populations, pooling information from a small but dedicated band of adder-watchers around the country. They, too, have consistently reported that the greatest threat to adders is disturbance. On further questioning, it become apparent that disturbance can have different causes. In some cases it refers to destruction of habitat - something that can happen even on protected sites, unintentionally, through \"\"habitat management\"\". Adders are also still being killed by humans, through overly heavy-handed management of some of the areas they inhabit. Sometimes disturbance can also result from people visiting well-known adder sites. So, can the general public help at all? Certainly. They can visit the Sliding Scales campaign website, a project for recording current or recent distributions of any snakes, as well as visiting the Add an Adder site - which aims to collect \"\"records from the past\"\" (both from personal experience and anecdotes from friends and relatives) to get a better idea of not only where adders are, but also where they used to be. If people find shed skins (or \"\"sloughs\"\") of adders, they can also be sent to the ARC Trust - those will be used in a research project to better understand adder genetics. The animals we love face a range of threats. We herpetologists wait with interest to learn more about the genetics of our adder populations. ' \n",

Prices dropped every year until they hit 2004 prices. It's a little better now but I don't know if it'll last,\"\" Fernandez said. Many in his region have already given up - \"\"they've ripped up 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of vines in the Aude,\"\" said Fernandez - and without a turnaround, the long-term outlook does not look good. \"\"There are only two winegrowers under 35,\"\" said Fernandez, gesturing to the group, which cultivates 500 hectares (1,236 acres) of sustainably farmed vines. In fact, none of the winegrowers encouraged their children to follow in their footsteps. It's too difficult, said several growers. So it's understandable these winegrowers listened when one of their top clients, Robert Joseph of Hugh Kevin & Robert, proposed bottling their Greener Planet wine in plastic, with an initial order of 75,000 bottles for Asda, the British subsidiary of the mammoth US discount retailer Walmart. \"\"A lot of the wine trade is a one-night stand relationship,\"\" said Robert Joseph of his company's collaborative, demand-driven project. \"\"We are trying to create an enduring relationship - consumer to distributor to producer to growers.\"\" Joseph and analysts at Euromonitor International say the move to plastic has been driven by demand from buyers as varied as airlines, Texas supermarkets, Nordic and Canadian state liquor monopolies and restaurant chains in Britain. \"\"We are in the most brutally capitalistic part of the wine business. We never own the wine,\"\" said Joseph of his company. \"\"We are a clear bellwether of what the market wants.\"\" And what a growing number of pragmatic tipplers seem to want are unbreakable, easily resealed, lighter wine bottles. \"\"We are expecting positive sales over the following weeks, especially as we head towards the summer months and there are more occasions such as outdoor festivals and concerts, where traditional glass wine bottles are banned,\"\" said Lottie Parsons, spokesperson for Asda. Distributors and retailers are particularly keen on plastic bottles - known in the trade as PET bottles, after the acronym for the material from which they are moulded - because they lighten the carbon footprint from freight, weighing three to five tons less per shipping container, according to Philippe Lauret, president of Les Celliers Jean d'Alibert. The price of the bottle remains the same, however, so producers don't cut costs. Lauret says his firm expects to supply Asda with 360,000 bottles of wine in plastic bottles this year. He also has an order for over 150,000 bottles of wine-in-PET for the Finnish state liquor monopoly. \"\"It's a good sign - it's taking off,\"\" said Lauret. Other wine producers in the Languedoc defend the trend. \"\"PET bottles are interesting for wines that are affordable and accessible for all consumers, like our varietal wines Couleurs du Sud,\"\" said Franck Autard, chief executive of Skalli, whose production of PET-bottled wine shot from zero in 2009 to 2.5 million bottles in 2010. Christine Cornil, export manager for another large Languedoc producer Auguste Bonlouis, said they delivered 20,000 plastic bottles of My PET Wine to the United States in January and will launch another PET-bottled wine in Britain this spring. Domestic sales hint that the French consumer might be less tradition-bound. Last year Auguste Bonlouis sold one million plastic bottles of wine to French supermarkets, two million small plastic bottles to restaurant chain Flunch and 50,000 plastic bottles of organic wine to retailer Monoprix. \"\"I think we can have both glass and plastic,\"\" said Fernandez, \"\"but there is risk of a huge battle in our profession if we bottle our wine in plastic.\"\" Plastic-bottled wine has met with vitriol in other parts of France, despite consumer demand. When the Boisset Family Estates lightened the load with PET-bottled Beaujolais Nouveau in Japan, Canada and the United States - \"\"where the environment is important,\"\" noted Nathalie Berges-Boisset - producers were outraged. The Beaujolais winegrowers union has since banned bottling their wine, including Nouveau Beaujolais, in plastic. Boisset put its Beaujolais back in glass but continues to bottle wines from other regions, including the Languedoc, in plastic. \"\"I'm not ashamed,\"\" said Boisset. \"\"We don't have any taboos and we believe in the environment.\"\" And plastic bottles undeniably open new markets for the wine trade. \"\"I'm looking at the boating world,\"\" said Joseph. \"\"You don't want glass on a boat.\"\" ' \n",

Initial studies also suggest that polyphenols in the syrup may help keep blood sugar levels in check, important for diabetics, by inhibiting enzymes that are involved in the conversion of carbohydrates to sugar, he said. The discoveries of new molecules in the syrup also provide chemists with leads that could prompt synthesis of medications to fight other diseases. The findings were presented this week at an annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Anaheim, California and are to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Functional Foods. The study was funded by the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. A total of 54 beneficial compounds were identified by the researchers in pure maple syrup from Quebec, including five of which have never been seen in nature. Among the new compounds is quebecol - named in honor of the Canadian province of Quebec, which leads the world in maple syrup production. The researchers believe it is created when a farmer boils off the water in maple sap to get maple syrup. It takes 40 liters (20.5 gallons) of sap to make one liter (two pints) of syrup. The sweet sap is collected from maple trees in the spring when freezing and thawing cycles cause it to rise and flow from taps hammered into tree trunks. Seeram said the irony of finding a potential anti-diabetes compound in a sweetener is not lost on him. \"\"Not all sweeteners are created equal,\"\" he said.

The scientists have successfully introduced human genes into 300 dairy cows to produce milk with the same properties as human breast milk. Human milk contains high quantities of key nutrients that can help to boost the immune system of babies and reduce the risk of infections. The scientists behind the research believe milk from herds of genetically modified cows could provide an alternative to human breast milk and formula milk for babies, which is often criticised as being an inferior substitute. They hope genetically modified dairy products from herds of similar cows could be sold in supermarkets. The research has the backing of a major biotechnology company. The work is likely to inflame opposition to GM foods. Critics of the technology and animal welfare groups reacted angrily to the research, questioning the safety of milk from genetically modified animals and its effect on the cattle's health. But Professor Ning Li, the scientist who led the research and director of the State Key Laboratories for AgroBiotechnology at the China Agricultural University insisted that the GM milk would be as safe to drink as milk from ordinary dairy cows. He said: \"\"The milk tastes stronger than normal milk. “We aim to commercialize some research in this area in coming three years. For the “human-like milk”, 10 years or maybe more time will be required to finally pour this enhanced milk into the consumer’s cup.” China is now leading the way in research on genetically modified food and the rules on the technology are more relaxed than those in place in Europe. The researchers used cloning technology to introduce human genes into the DNA of Holstein dairy cows before the genetically modified embryos were implanted into surrogate cows. Writing in the scientific peer-reviewed journal Public Library of Science One, the researchers said they were able to create cows that produced milk containing a human protein called lysozyme, Lysozyme is an antimicrobial protein naturally found in large quantities in human breast milk. It helps to protect infants from bacterial infections during their early days of life. They created cows that produce another protein from human milk called lactoferrin, which helps to boost the numbers of immune cells in babies. A third human milk protein called alpha-lactalbumin was also produced by the cows. The scientists also revealed at an exhibition at the China Agricultural University that they have boosted milk fat content by around 20 per cent and have also changed the levels of milk solids, making it closer to the composition of human milk as well as having the same immune-boosting properties. Professor Li and his colleagues, who have been working with the Beijing GenProtein Biotechnology Company, said their work has shown it was possible to \"\"humanise\"\" cows milk. In all, the scientists said they have produced a herd of around 300 cows that are able to produce human-like milk. The transgenic animals are physically identical to ordinary cows. Writing in the journal, Professor Li said: \"\"Our study describes transgenic cattle whose milk offers the similar nutritional benefits as human milk. \"\"The modified bovine milk is a possible substitute for human milk. It fulfilled the conception of humanising the bovine milk.\"\" Speaking to The Sunday Telegraph , he added the “human-like milk” would provide “much higher nutritional content”. He said they had managed to produce three generations of GM cows but for commercial production there would need to be large numbers of cows produced. He said: “Human milk contains the ‘just right’ proportions of protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and vitamins for an infant’s optimal growth and development. “As our daily food, the cow’s milk provided us the basic source of nutrition. But the digestion and absorption problems made it not the perfect food for human being.\"\" The researchers also insist having antimicrobial proteins in the cows milk can also be good for the animals by helping to reduce infections of their udders. Genetically modified food has become a highly controversial subject and currently they can only be sold in the UK and Europe if they have passed extensive safety testing. The consumer response to GM food has also been highly negative, resulting in many supermarkets seeking to source products that are GM free. Campaigners claim GM technology poses a threat to the environment as genes from modified plants can get into wild plant populations and weeds, while they also believe there are doubts about the safety of such foods. Scientists insist genetically modified foods are unlikely to pose a threat to food safety and in the United States consumers have been eating genetically modified foods for more decades. However, during two experiments by the Chinese researchers, which resulted in 42 transgenic calves being born, just 26 of the animals survived after ten died shortly after birth, most with gastrointestinal disease, and a further six died within six months of birth. Researchers accept that the cloning technology used in genetic modification can affect the development and survival of cloned animals, although the reason why is not well understood. A spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Animals said the organisation was \"\"extremely concerned\"\" about how the GM cows had been produced. She said: \"\"Offspring of cloned animals often suffer health and welfare problems, so this would be a grave concern. \"\"Why do we need this milk – what is it giving us that we haven't already got.\"\" Helen Wallace, director of biotechnology monitoring group GeneWatch UK, said: \"\"We have major concerns about this research to genetically modify cows with human genes. \"\"There are major welfare issues with genetically modified animals as you get high numbers of still births. \"\"There is a question about whether milk from these cows is going to be safe from humans and it is really hard to tell that unless you do large clinical trials like you would a drug, so there will be uncertainty about whether it could be harmful to some people. \"\"Ethically there are issues about mass producing animals in this way.\"\" Professor Keith Campbell, a biologist at the University of Nottingham works with transgenic animals, said: \"\"Genetically modified animals and plants are not going to be harmful unless you deliberately put in a gene that is going to be poisonous. Why would anyone do that in a food? \"\"Genetically modified food, if done correctly, can provide huge benefit for consumers in terms of producing better products.\"\" ' \n",
      "Warning! Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'My favourite particle: the neutrino I started writing about neutrinos because I love them. They are quite magical really; the Universe is completely swarming with them (they are the second most abundant particle after photons) but we know practically nothing about them. And what we do know is really weird. I wrote down \"\"My favourite particle: the neutrino\"\" to fit in with the other particle articles. But it isn't my favourite particle. I toyed with \"\"Not my favourite particle: the neutrino\"\" but that just felt disrespectful. Then I decided it doesn't matter what I write at the top of the page. Why do I need this post to fall into line with the others? I suppose it's because I want symmetry. I want that warm, comfortable-yet-exciting feeling you get when starting to read the next book in a trilogy. The neutrino was postulated (imagined-up) for a similar reason: the desire for symmetry. A hundred years (ish) ago there was lots of great experimental science going on. There was no clear idea what atoms were, but there was an understanding that they weren't solid balls. Ernest Rutherford and others had established, through experiments, that there was a nucleus in the center of an atom and had postulated that electrons were \"\"in orbit\"\" around this nucleus. He came up with this description based purely on his experimental results: there was no theory at the time that predicted this. I feel quite nostalgic for this sort of experiment-driven theory. In the era of the LHC it is not the done thing to come up with a new theory to describe what we see experimentally. In general, our results have to fit some theory that has already been proposed. When they don't (they don't) we tune the theoretical predictions to match our data, like twiddling a load of knobs (most of these theory predictors, which we call Monte Carlo, have twenty or thirty knobs) until we get some agreement. I am moaning about this, but really we don't have a choice. Anyway, back to the good old days. Something called Beta decay had been observed. They had a name for it before they knew it for what it was. It was a nice bit of real-world, useful, observational science. It was noticed that some atoms would emit radiation without any provocation to do so. This is what we call radioactivity. Active radiation. Nothing to do with the radio, other than that radio also works via radiation. Radio is carried by electromagnetic radiation (my first love - the photon). What radiation is is the loss of energy by something. That energy invariably travels somewhere else in some form or other. But the thing with radioactivity is it is not deliberate. It just happens \"\"naturally\"\". When first discovered it triggered a whole host of money-making schemes, similar to modern-day homeopathy I suppose, except homeopaths make their millions out of plain water and packaging, whereas back in the day the quacks were raking it in by selling people radioactive face-cream. The scientists rebelled, lots of people got cancer and the business end closed. I laughed at these adverts and showed my mates, and then I felt really sad because I thought about people in the future (okay, the present) laughing at my friends for buying 0% proof hogswart. Anyway (again), the science continued, and we realized that what was happening was that part of the atom, in fact part of the nucleus, was \"\"decaying\"\". It was established that the radiation being emitted was electrons, because the measurement of the emitted particles' charge and mass was exactly the same as for electrons. The electrons weren't being thrown \"\"out of orbit\"\", they were being emitted from the nucleus. This is interesting, because the atomic nucleus only contains protons (with a charge of +1) and neutrons (with a charge of zero). To get a negatively charged particle out of this we thought that the neutron must decay into a proton and an electron: zero charge= +1 and -1. Great. This fitted nicely with the experimental measurement of the atom before and after it went through Beta decay. But this is where things stopped being comfortable. This picture predicts precisely the energy that the emitted radiation (the electron) must have. Depending on what kind of atom is doing the decay, we should be able to predict exactly how much energy the electron has.When they measured the energy carried by these emitted electrons, they found that the electrons could have any energy. This was a huge problem because conservation of energy was (and is) the closest we get to feeling comfortable with any knowledge in particle physics. It always works. We don't have to appeal to the fact that the theory is beautiful and elegant, we just do cold, hard experiments. And warm, soft ones. Any kind of one. We always get the same answer: energy is conserved. Always. But not in radioactivity. Wolfgang Pauli wasn't having any of it. There must be something else emitted, something that the instruments were not detecting. Pauli described the properties that this invisible particle must have; It is neutral (no charge), it has a small (or zero) mass and it has spin half like the electron. If the new particle was emitted along with the electron, then the electron could have any energy, because the total energy emitted could still add up to be the exact value predicted by the theory. The new particle would have to be a ghost, traveling through matter without interacting at all. Then we could explain why it was not detected. Of course this was not a comfortable place to be, but it was slightly less uncomfortable than violating the law of conservation of energy. Pauli was aware of his responsibility, famously saying \"\"I have done a terrible thing. I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected\"\". Wolfgang Pauli: he knew his stuff. Is it okay to make a prediction that we cannot test? Science is about trying to describe the way the world works; our understanding should be based on what we observe and our theories should be testable. This is why some experimentalists laugh at string theory. I for one am happy to ignore it until someone comes up with a way for us to test its validity. Okay, some of the reason I ignore it is because it is hard, but I would be much more inclined to make the effort if I thought it was any use. Thankfully, the little neutral ones, neutrinos, can be detected. It is just very, very difficult to do. This is because they simply do not interact with the particles that make up matter. Neutrinos can fly past an atom as if it were not there. They are neutral, so they are not affected by electromagnetic fields. The only thing in nature they have anything to do with is the weak nuclear force, so they tend to just whizz through the universe, through planets and through us, leaving no trace. We do detect the odd one. The first was 25 years after Pauli's prediction, by Cowan and Reines. Back in 1987 we saw a whopping 24 of them in just a few seconds, thanks to a supernova going off in the vicinity. But generally they are a bugger to catch. So what do we know about neutrinos now? Almost nothing, but the little bit we do know is very interesting indeed. The standard model of particle physics (the theory that we are most happy with when putting together all the little bits of knowledge we have gathered from thousands of experiments over a hundred years) tells us that neutrinos have no mass, like photons. We now know that this is not the case. Neutrinos do have mass. We know that the three kinds of neutrinos must all have different masses, so at least two of them cannot be zero. I feel like nobody really talks about this. Perhaps I hang out with the wrong kind of physicists. Neutrino experiments have shown the standard model to be deeply flawed, yet we still persist in calling it \"\"the standard model\"\". I have finished writing this now without actually saying a single thing about why I love the neutrino. I haven't mentioned that they are able to change flavour (neutrino oscillations) or that they could be their own antiparticle (are they Majorana or Dirac particles?) or that they can help us understand dark matter, or that the fate of the universe is in their hands. Each one of these things is completely deserving of its own post, written by someone who knows their onions and is able to write something that is not 90% digression. ' \n",

Nobody will argue that John Calipari and Jim Calhoun are saints, either. The men on the sidelines for the Kentucky-Connecticut Final Four matchup have had their share of trouble - with each other, the programs they run and the NCAA. They are a microcosm of everything that's right and wrong in college basketball - a coach-driven game where good leaders can elevate programs and players to new levels but the road to success often produces its fair share of cringeworthy dealing. Calipari leads the fourth-seeded Wildcats (29-8) against Calhoun and the third-seeded Huskies (30-9) in the second semifinal Saturday. Both coaches coaxed a turnaround out of their young, struggling teams to make unexpected trips to the game's biggest stage - the third for Calipari and fourth for Calhoun. On the eve of the game, their histories were as lively a topic as the success of their teams. One of the first questions Calipari fielded Friday was whether he is the 2000\"\"s version of former UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian, a coach who did a lot of winning in his day but did it with his phone number firmly entrenched on the NCAA's speed dial. The question slid off the Wildcats coach as smoothly as good Kentucky bourbon. \"\"I respect everything that Jerry did - his kids, how they played, all those things,\"\" Calipari said. \"\"But, no, I think I'm the 2011 John Calipari. I don't know what that means, and I hate to talk in the third party. But I am who I am.\"\" Calipari is back in Houston, where three years ago he won two games at the regional to lead Memphis to the Final Four, only to leave that school a year later, just as the program was running into NCAA problems involving the recruitment of Derrick Rose. Calipari's first Final Four visit, with Massachusetts back in 1996, also has been scrubbed by the NCAA. Which led to another tongue-in-cheek question: How does it feel to be coaching in your first Final Four? \"\"I don't deal with that,\"\" said the 52-year-old coach, who spent four years in the NBA between his stints at UMass and Memphis. \"\"We've been here three times. Those players played those games and did what they were supposed to. I'm so proud of what they've all accomplished.\"\" He says this without apology. Though his schools suffered, Calipari was not found at fault in either of the NCAA probes. The so-called problems between Cal and Cal began during those UMass days, when the coaches were on top of each other in neighboring states - one trying to protect his turf and the other trying to carve out his own. The 68-year-old Calhoun lightheartedly reprised the complaints he raised more than a decade ago about Calipari - a Pittsburgh native trying to muscle his way through New England - but made it clear the enmity has died down as the years have passed. \"\"From a generational standpoint, to the fact that John really was trying to claim New England,\"\" Calhoun said of the lack of a true friendship with his counterpart. Then, he affected his best Boston accent: \"\"He could never say he pahked the caah in Hahvahd Yahd, he didn't know what clam chowder really was.

In halting their longest losing streak of the season, the Suns beat the Clippers for the eighth consecutive time at US Airways Center. Los Angeles has not won at Phoenix since March 17, 2007. Nash, the Suns' scoring leader and the league leader in assists, was a late scratch because of flulike symptoms. This was the fifth game he missed this season, but the first time the Suns won without him. Brooks finished with 17 points and six assists. Dowdell, a rookie, had a season-high 14 points and five assists. The Suns had six players in double figures. Hakim Warrick added 17 points and 10 rebounds, Jared Dudley scored 16, and Marcin Gortat had 10 points and 11 rebounds. Eric Gordon led the Clippers with 21 points, and Blake Griffin had 20 points and 13 rebounds. However, Griffin shot only 6 of 15 from the field. The Suns took command early in the second quarter. With the score tied at 32, they outscored the Clippers 25-12 through the remainder of the period and assumed a 57-44 halftime lead. Third-string point guard Dowdell, getting extended playing time because of Nash's absence, sparked the burst with 10 points and three assists. After missing his first two shots badly - they didn't even hit the rim - Dowdell connected on four consecutive attempts, mostly knifing his way through the Clippers' defense. Meanwhile, the Suns' usually porous defense did a commendable job on Griffin, the Clippers' high-scoring rookie. Although Griffin exhilarated the crowd with two of his patented slam dunks, he was only 4 of 10 for 10 points in the first half. Following a mediocre shooting first period, the Suns sizzled in the second quarter, hitting 13 of 21 for 61 percent. Instead of settling for 3-point attempts, which they often do, the Suns were taking the ball to the basket and scored 28 points in the paint. Hill was the game's high scorer at halftime with 13 points, including 11 in the first quarter, when he was 5 for 6 as Phoenix took a 25-23 lead. With Brooks on the floor in the third quarter, the Suns widened their advantage to 88-70 by the end of the period. Brooks accounted for 10 points and three assists during the period. Notes The Suns open a five-game, eight-day road trip Sunday at San Antonio, followed by Chicago, Minnesota, New Orleans and Dallas before they return home for their final two games of the season. ... The Clippers have six games remaining, all against teams in the playoffs or still in contention - two each against Oklahoma City and Memphis, and one each against Dallas and Houston. ... Before Friday, Nash was the NBA leader in assists with 11.4 per game, his best average since the 2006-07 season. He also led all NBA players with 48 double-digit assists games and led NBA guards with 41 double-doubles. Copyright 2011 by STATS LLC and The Associated Press.

No problem for the Phoenix Suns, who routed the Los Angeles Clippers 111-98 despite missing their star point guard. Balanced scoring led to six Suns players in double figures. They were led by the ageless wonder, 38-year-old Grant Hill, who scored 19 points on 6-of-9 from the field. Hakim Warrick had 19, Jared Dudley had 16, Zabian Dowdell scored 14, Aaron Brooks put up 12 and Marcin Gortat had 10 points to go with his 11 rebounds. Both teams were hampered by ills - the Suns' Nash and Gortat were both battling the flu, leaving Nash out of the lineup while Gortat stayed in as he toughed through his sickness. The Clippers were minus center Chris Kaman, who was also dealing with a viral illness. Unfortunately, the Clippers' ills extended to the basketball court. They broke out with a rash of turnovers, 21 for the night. \"\"A lot of mistakes,\"\" said Clippers coach Vinny Del Negro. \"\"Just a lot of mistakes and we're always playing catch-up all the time and it makes it tough.\"\" The Suns shot the ball with pinpoint precision, hitting 52 percent from the field. A 32-21 second quarter put the Suns up by 13 at halftime, which mirrored the point total for Hill in the first half. Things went from bad to worse as the Suns' lead ballooned to 22 in the third quarter and then 25 in the fourth. Anything the Clippers did from then on would be too little too late. Advertisement Blake Griffin had 20 points and 13 rebounds while Eric Gordon contributed 21 points, including 4-of-9 from three-point range. Randy Foye tallied 10 points off the bench. \"\"We got a few guys that are giving a real sound effort overall I think and some guys that are trying,\"\" said Del Negro. \"\"We're not converting when we need to.

Beyond the talent, the monster signings, and even the big injuries, the Phillies have an incredible will to win, and they showed that again yesterday, coming up with a six-pack of singles in the ninth inning to score three runs to stun the Astros, 5-4, at Citizens Bank Park in their opener, giving the Mets a glimpse of what awaits them next week. \"\"That was just desire to win,\"\" said Jimmy Rollins, who got the rally started with a single to right.

Burnett, today in their second game. \"\"It's good to have Cliff coming up [tonight],\"\" Rollins said with a knowing smile. Halladay, who allowed only one run over six innings, said: \"\"With this team, there are never games when you feel like you've lost hope. Games like today show you we are going to win as a team all year. That's the only way we are going to achieve the goals we want to achieve.\"\" The Phillies have won the NL East four straight years and have delivered two pennants and one World Series victory over that span. They never panic. That is why their baseball lives have been so rewarding since the Mets' Great Collapse while the Mets' world has been so hopeless. With no Chase Utley (knee) at second, no Brad Lidge (shoulder) in the bullpen and no Jayson Werth in right, Werth's replacement Ben Francisco bounced back from a bad day to rip an RBI single in the ninth. Young John Mayberry Jr., who will see time in right, delivered the winning base hit, a line drive over the head of drawn-in center fielder Michael Bourn. Ex-Mets castoff Wilson Valdez also delivered an RBI-single against closer Brandon Lyon. All this happened after Philly fans, of course, started to boo. Rollins said one fan even jumped on the dugout and screamed that his American Legion team could do better. \"\"Everybody was a little panicked,\"\" Francisco said of the outside world's reaction to the Utley injury and other problems going on around the Phillies, \"\"but we got good players here.\"\" Said Mayberry of his shaving-cream pie in the face day: \"\"This is the script I would have written.\"\" The Phillies forever remain the team to beat. \"\"We have a bull's-eye on our back,\"\" Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said. After being beaten in the NLCS last October by the Giants, who went on to win the World Series, the Phillies are more determined than ever to win it all this season. They think they will with the addition of Lee. That's what makes this baseball reality series so much more interesting than so many other teams. It only took one game for the Phils to deliver the magic formula again. Make no mistake, the Phillies work at their craft. Manuel is all about taking the right approach at the plate. In spring training, Rollins said, they worked daily in batting practice on hitting singles to get the runner home. The six singles didn't just happen. Rollins said this was the kind of Opening Day that memories are made of when you are a Phillie. He listed his top three Opening Day memories. \"\"We got the chance to open up the stadium, and we got the chance to get our rings, and then we got today,\"\" he said.

The absence of big-name players on the roster would seem to indicate otherwise, but the Dodgers' opening-day payroll was higher this year than it was in 2009, when the team made its last playoff appearance. Counting the five players who are on the disabled list, the Dodgers will pay the players on their opening-day roster more than $95 million, according to salary figures filed with the union. They are on the hook for an additional $15 million-plus in salary deferments from previous seasons. The 2009 Dodgers, who had Manny Ramirez , started the season with a payroll of approximately $90 million, plus another $11 million or so in deferments. The 2009 team had a couple of major bargains turn into key performers — Randy Wolf ($5 million) and Orlando Hudson ($3 million). The $95-million figure marks a significant increase from last season, when the Dodgers opened the season with an $83-million payroll. The Dodgers' highest-paid player this year is Rafael Furcal , who will earn $12 million in the final year of a three-year, $30-million contract. The five players on the disabled list — Casey Blake , Jon Garland , Vicente Padilla , Jay Gibbons and Dioner Navarro — will make a combined $12.5 million. The Dodgers have seven players with zero to three years of major league experience, including opening-day starter Clayton Kershaw , whom they can essentially pay whatever they like. These players will earn anywhere from $414,000 ( Ivan DeJesus Jr. ) to $500,000 (Kershaw). The roster also includes three players who were invited to spring training on minor league contracts — Lance Cormier ($800,000), Mike MacDougal ($500,000) and Aaron Miles ($500,000). Uribe sits out Juan Uribe was out of the lineup, as the area above his left elbow was swollen as a result of a pitch by Tim Lincecum that struck him the previous night. \"\"It hurts,\"\" Uribe said. Miles took his place in the lineup. Uribe said he didn't think he would be out for more than a couple of days — a prediction that seemed to be supported by the results of an X-ray exam, which were negative. DeJesus makes debut DeJesus said the game on Friday was \"\"another game,\"\" but his stoicism was betrayed by the smile on his face. After 562 games in the minor leagues, the 23-year-old was about to make his major league debut. DeJesus, who started at second base and batted in the No. 2 spot, is the son of Ivan DeJesus , a longtime major league infielder. The elder DeJesus played for the Dodgers from 1974-76. \"\"I've been waiting my whole life for this,\"\" DeJesus Jr. said. DeJesus said his mother and wife were in the stands at Dodger Stadium. His father couldn't be there because he is the third-base coach for the Chicago Cubs, who hosted the Pittsburgh Pirates. Short hops For every home run Andre Ethier hits this season, Farmer John will donate 1,000 pounds of meat to the Union Rescue Mission. Ethier isn't the only Dodger involved in a performance-based charitable effort. Kershaw will donate $1,000 for every batter he strikes out toward the construction of an orphanage in Zambia, where he and his wife visited in the off-season on a religious mission.

The first six, well, they were simply too much to overcome. Josh Johnson took a no-hitter into the seventh inning, John Buck hit a grand slam in his Florida debut and the Marlins beat the Mets 6-2 on Friday night. Willie Harris had a leadoff double in the seventh for New York's first hit off Johnson (1-0). Carlos Beltran lined an RBI double and Ike Davis knocked in another run with a groundout off Johnson for the Mets, who had only one returner from their 2010 opening-day lineup — third baseman David Wright. \"\"We were getting no-hit through six innings,\"\" Collins said after his debut as the Mets\"\" skipper. \"\"And all of a sudden we had a ballgame . . . We just ran into a real, real good pitcher and we'll run into some more.\"\" The Mets closed to 5-2 in the seventh and had the tying run to the plate with two outs, but Marlins reliever Mike Dunn struck out Scott Hairston. Logan Morrison also homered and Gaby Sanchez added an RBI single for the Marlins, who played their 19th and final opener at Sun Life Stadium. The team moves into a new ballpark in 2012. \"\"It's what I set out there to do, to get us off on a good foot,\"\" said Johnson, who moved to 8-1 against the Mets — his only loss coming in last year's season opener at Citi Field. \"\"I thought about last year a lot, the first game of the season last year. It didn't sit well with me. I wanted to go out there and make sure I competed a lot better than that, and I did.\"\" Johnson allowed three hits and two runs in the seventh, leaving with two outs and getting an ovation from the crowd of 41,237, Florida's largest since a visit by the Yankees in June 2009. He struck out three and walked two in 6 2-3 innings. \"\"He was pretty good tonight,\"\" Collins said. \"\"When we got behind, he's pretty tough to catch up against. You don't get that many good pitches to hit.\"\" Mike Pelfrey (0-1) gave up five runs, four hits and four walks in 4 1-3 innings for the Mets, who saw their streak of five straight opening-day wins snapped. \"\"You come into the game against Josh Johnson, you know you have to be good and I wasn't very good tonight,\"\" Pelfrey said. \"\"I knew I was going to have to throw up a lot of zeroes to win. He outpitched me tonight. He deserved to win and I didn't.\"\" Pelfrey loaded the bases with one out in the fourth by walking Mike Stanton and Morrison and giving up a double to Sanchez. Pelfrey quickly got a two-strike count on Buck, but made a mistake with a 2-2 offering. Buck - an All-Star for Toronto last year who got an $18 million, three-year deal from Florida in November — drove a fly ball the opposite way to right-center, clearing the wall for his third career grand slam. It was the fourth opening-day slam in Marlins history, and brought a curtain call that lasted more than a minute before the catcher finally emerged to acknowledge the crowd. Buck thought he didn't get enough to hit it out. \"\"I thought I missed it,\"\" he said. \"\"I thought it was going to be a deep flyball.\"\" The Mets likely hoped the same. They gave up a major league-high 12 slams in 2010, and were the only team not to hit one. The way they fare against Johnson, it hardly mattered. He has faced the Mets 13 times and compiled a 2.73 ERA. \"\"We ran up against a good pitcher tonight,\"\" Harris said. \"\"You've got to tip your hat to the guy. He pitched extremely well. He had all of his pitches working. That's big J.J. He knows what he's doing out there.\"\" Josh Thole had a chance for the Mets\"\" first hit in the sixth, but his grounder up the middle was fielded by shortstop Hanley Ramirez, who spun and threw easily for the out. But in the seventh, Harris' double was clean, ending Johnson's bid to join Bob Feller in one of baseball's most exclusive clubs - the one for those throwing opening-day no-hitters. Feller had baseball's only one of those in 1940. NOTES: The Mets fell to 32-18 on opening day . . . Marlins manager Edwin Rodriguez was participating in his first opening day in the majors after more than three decades in baseball . . .

He was 82. \"\"All he wanted to do was make it to opening day, and he made it,\"\" said his nephew, Tom Dougherty. Gorman was Boston's GM from 1984 to 1993. His greatest success was with the 1986 Red Sox led by Roger Clemens , Wade Boggs , and Jim Rice , who came back to beat the California Angels in the AL Championship Series in a classic, then lost the world title to the Mets in a World Series that turned on the Game 6 play in which Mookie Wilson's slow roller went through Bill Buckner's legs. New York went on to win Game 7. The close miss further embittered Boston fans, but not Gorman.

And I will have lunch.\"\" Now that's long-term thinking, or something Kansas City Royals relievers have switched sides. (We know what you're thinking: Who could blame them?)

One wonders what they had tried in the intervening 38 years: An elaborate system of mirrors? Sending notes over to the opposing team? Carrier pigeons? In other Royals news: The whole team is barely making more than New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez this year.

We're glad we handled our business and we don't have to wait for this team or that team to lose. We did it in our own manner, especially from where we came from, 3-13 and that tough start.\"\" Coach Doug Collins impressed upon anyone who would listen early in the season how important it was for his two veterans, Brand and Andre Iguodala, to be leaders on the court and vocal directors. The two have not disappointed their coach, helping to lead a painfully young team through that tough start. It is now not only a playoff team, but one that will have a first-round opponent more than a little nervous. \"\"To do this tonight in front of our home fans is such an accomplishment,\"\" said Collins, who has a chance to lead the Sixers to their first winning season since 2004-05. \"\"EB and Dre really led the way for us. And Thad [Young] has been amazing. When he and Lou [Williams] play like they do off the bench, it makes us a whole different team.\"\" The Sixers had it all running smoothly last night, so much so that the normally soppy Collins was pretty much bone dry after the game. Young scored a game-high 22, including four slam dunks and various other inside-the-lane finishes. Brand added 21, while Jrue Holiday posted 17 points, seven assists and six rebounds. Iguodala added 14 points and seven assists and did his usual stellar job defensively, at times even shutting down Nets All-Star point guard Deron Williams. Last season, swingman Young made life easy on his defenders, many times opting for stand-still jump shots. This year, as designed by Collins, Young is torturing foes with dizzying drives to the basket, often contorting himself in ways usually saved for a circus. He has prospered greatly under Collins' tutelage and will be one of the main weapons at his coach's disposal come the postseason. \"\"[Making the playoffs] is much more memorable,\"\" said Young, who will be making his third playoff appearance with the club. \"\"To see where we came from, 3-13, and now we've clinched a playoff spot with our 40th win. It's definitely a great feeling and we've got a great group of guys here. We're all standup guys, we all love each other and we're ready to go to battle for each other each and every night.\"\" The lead grew to as many as 33 early in the fourth quarter, enabling Collins to get some much-needed rest for some of his players, especially Iguodala and Brand, who have been battling injuries. And with the lack of resistance from the Nets for most of the night, those who did play significant minutes didn't seem to have to exert much energy. Holiday, being only 20, often is asked to name his favorite point guards in the league. Without hesitation, he points out Williams. In just his second game back after missing six with a wrist injury, Williams didn't do much to cement himself in Holiday's idol category, scoring only four points in a little more than 22 minutes and dealing seven assists. Though he never knows how his tendinitis-ridden right knee is going to feel, Iguodala must have been feeling pretty good at the beginning of the game as he scored 12 points in the first quarter, hitting a pair of three-pointers and slicing strong to the basket. \"\"Tonight I think he hit a couple of early jumpers, which got him going,\"\" Collins said. \"\"I think that really ignites the rest of his game, then he's slashing and cutting. He's one of the most unselfish players I've ever been around. I've never seen a guy who gets more excited for kicking the ball to a guy hitting a shot than he does.\"\" Iguodala's hot start propelled the big win and allowed for him and Brand to sit the fourth quarter, which could come in handy tonight when the team faces the Bucks in Milwaukee. Of course, Cliff Lee will be taking the mound for the Phillies, so to many, the Sixers will be an afterthought once again. No matter to them. They proved that they're something the Phillies aren't yet this year - a playoff team. Six shots Every Sixer played at least 5 minutes and Andre Iguodala played the most time, a little more than 32 minutes . . . The Sixers improved to 11-2 when Thaddeus Young scores 20 or more.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Calipari sticking with one-and-done approach John Calipari didn't come up with the \"\"one-and-done\"\" rule. Didn't write it. Didn't implement it. The Kentucky coach didn't even really approve of it when the NBA decided in 2006 that players needed to be a year removed from high school before heading to the pros. Yet Calipari has mastered it in a way few of his peers have, pulling off a seemingly impossible task season after season: molding the nation's top recruiting class into NBA-ready pros in six short months while somehow getting them to buy into the team-first concept in the process. Kentucky plays Connecticut in its first Final Four game in 13 years Saturday with a roster headlined by freshmen Brandon Knight, Terrence Jones and Doron Lamb. A year ago, they were all high school seniors. Next fall, Knight and Jones will likely be getting paid to play. And Calipari will welcome another gifted handful of McDonald's All-Americans and attempt to do it all over again. It's the Calipari way. And it's probably not going anywhere. \"\"To be the best, I really believe you have to have the best players,\"\" Calipari said. \"\"You want to be the best. You ain't coaching them up. You can play that game if you choose to.\"\" Some do, and do it well. The rosters of Virginia Commonwealth and Butler are stacked with upperclassmen who have bought into the system and flourished as they matured. Connecticut is led by charismatic junior Kemba Walker and a pack of underclassmen, all of whom are expected to return next fall. The Huskies have produced some of the NBA's top players through the years. And, all of them opted to stay at least two years. \"\"If we start hearing, \"\"Coach, I'll only be there (one year) ... well, we really don't talk that way at UConn,\"\"\"\" UConn coach Jim Calhoun said. Calipari hears it all the time, and it doesn't bother him even if each season is likely to feature a team full of shooting stars than slow-burning comets. Calipari has long supported baseball's rule that allows players to enter the draft right out of high school or commit to at least three years of college. \"\"Man, I wish this was the \"\"70s (and) I had these guys for three years, we wouldn't lose any games,\"\" Calipari said. Not that the current structure has proven difficult for him to navigate. His teams have won an average of 33.5 games since the one-and-done rule was instituted. He preaches he tries to put together a \"\"players first\"\" program, and the message is attractive to players looking to iron out the wrinkles before becoming millionaires. \"\"He tells you coming in that he's going to let you play and let you make mistakes, but he's going to let you learn from them,\"\" said Washington Wizards rookie John Wall, who played one season for Kentucky before bolting to the NBA. \"\"He gives you an opportunity to go in there and show your talent, and he knows he's a good enough coach that he can go out and get the same type of guy (the next year).\"\" The next class of Wildcats are already set to go. If Knight and Jones go pro later this spring, they'll be replaced by another talented group led by forward Anthony Davis and point guard Marquis Teague, both of whom could have very short stays in Lexington. Recruiting talented but highly volatile stars can come at a price. The NCAA ordered Memphis to vacate all 38 of its wins during the 2007-08 season for using an ineligible player believed to be Derrick Rose, who spent a season at Memphis before becoming the No. 1 overall pick in the 2008 NBA draft. It's a risk some programs deem too dangerous. Notre Dame coach Mike Brey is reluctant to recruit a player who may only stick around for a season, citing the school's academic demands and the entourages that surround some of the nation's top players. \"\"A lot of one-and-done guys come with a lot of coaching already from people helping them along the way,\"\" said Brey, who led the Irish to a 27-7 record behind senior guard Ben Hansbrough. \"\"At this point in my career, I don't know if I want to deal with that.\"\" The Irish have been successful with a different type of short-term players: transfers like Hansbrough, who came to Notre Dame after two years at Mississippi State. Still, Hansbrough remained with the school for three seasons, sitting out one under NCAA transfer rules before developing into one of the Big East's best shooters as a junior and senior. Besides the outside distractions, introducing a one-year player in a locker room full of veterans could upset the delicate balance of the locker room. Butler has made consecutive Final Fours \"\"the Butler Way,\"\" using a low-key, humble approach championed by coach Brad Stevens. If the Bulldogs were to bring a hotshot recruit in, the chemistry may change, and not for the better. \"\"We're not individuals here, we're not playing for an individual star or something like that,\"\" Butler guard Chase Stigall said. \"\"We're trying to build a program. The program was started a long time ago.\"\" So was Kentucky's, though Calipari isn't one to dwell on the past. He caused a stir last June when he called the night five Wildcats _ four of them freshmen _ were selected in the first round of the NBA draft the greatest day in the program's history, the school's seven national championships included. Calipari is unapologetic in his approach. He values experience, but he covets talent. \"\"If I have a choice between a talented team and an experienced team, I'm taking talent every time,\"\" he said. \"\"I can try to figure out how to get them to defend, how to play together, all of those things.\"\" Though he's the most accomplished coach when it comes to attracting one-and-dones, he's hardly alone in the pursuit of potential one-year phenoms. Ohio State rode freshmen Greg Oden and Mike Conley to an appearance in the national title game in 2007. Kevin Love took UCLA to the Final Four in 2008. Kevin Durant played just one season at Texas. Same for Michael Beasley at Kansas State. The sight of players treating college as a 12-month way station between high school and the NBA doesn't sit well with NCAA president Mark Emmert, though he is powerless to stop it. \"\"I would very much like to not have that become the image of intercollegiate basketball, even though there are some that do that,\"\" Emmert said. \"\"I'd certainly like kids to stay in college and prepare themselves for the rest of their lives.\"\" So would Calipari, who says he'd love to coach freshman guard Brandon Knight for the next 15 years. He entered Saturday knowing he may not coach Knight for 15 more hours. That's fine. He didn't make up the rules. He swears he's just trying to play by them. \"\"My (best) option is to recruit the best players we have, the best students we can recruit, and then coach \"\"em and get \"\"em to believe in themselves, get \"\"em to reach their dreams,\"\" Calipari said. \"\"If that is done after a year, then I'll deal with it.\"\" ___ ' \n",

Bowers, whose right knee surgery earlier this year has threatened his top-10 status in the NFL draft, worked out at Clemson University while Broncos executive vice president of football operations John Elway, general manager Brian Xanders and coach John Fox elected to stay home and meet with Washington quarterback Jake Locker instead. Locker was at the team's Dove Valley complex. The Broncos, who have repeatedly said they like their quarterback triumvirate of Kyle Orton, Tim Tebow and Brady Quinn, also attended Missouri quarterback Blaine Gabbert's workout last month and are scheduled to be the last stop on Auburn quarterback Cam Newton's tour of teams later this month. Locker had been the top-ranked senior prospect by many teams before the 2010 season began, but he saw his draft stock take a hit as the Huskies struggled early last season before winning their last four games to finish 7-6, including a victory in the Holiday Bowl. Locker looked indecisive in the pocket at times this past season, but he's a natural athlete who rushed for more than 300 yards and passed for more than 2,000 yards in three of his four seasons. Locker had a difficult week at the Senior Bowl in January as he struggled with his accuracy. But he has performed well in workouts. Bowers, who had been a popular pick for the defense-starved Broncos at No. 2 by many draft analysts earlier this year, has seen his draft status take a potentially multimillion- dollar hit because of surgery just after the season to repair cartilage in his right knee. Bowers did not work out at the scouting combine in February as he recovered, nor did he work out at Clemson's first pro day last month. On Friday, with Broncos director of college scouting Matt Russell on hand, Bowers went through an entire workout. Representatives from three teams on hand said he still was not 100 percent and appeared to have difficulty cutting on the repaired leg. His 40-yard dash times were in the high 4.8s and low 4.9s — depending on the watch — which are slightly slower than he likely would have run before the surgery. Teams examined Bowers' knee closely during the medical exam at the combine, and several scouts have said some team officials are concerned the knee may still give Bowers trouble. Bowers is 6-feet-3, 280 pounds and is a force when healthy. He led the nation in sacks in 2010 with 15 1/2 and won the Nagurski and Ted Hendricks awards. The Broncos have an interest in another Clemson defensive lineman who worked out Friday, tackle Jarvis Jenkins. At 6-4, 310 pounds, Jenkins showed good power and quickness off the ball at the Senior Bowl practices in January. Jeff Legwold: 303-954-2359 or jlegwold@denverpost.com ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Giants lose to Dodgers again, 4-3 LOS ANGELES - Brandon Belt's first major league home run was a three-run objet d'art. It slipped like a pearl over the center-field fence, landed in a restricted area and gave the Giants a two-run advantage in the fourth inning Friday night. \"\"Hopefully I'll get it back,\"\" the rookie said. \"\"Unless some security guard threw it in the trash.\"\" Discarding priceless items? Two games and five errors into 2011, that's been the Giants' sad refrain. For the second consecutive night, bad throws and clanking glovework resulted in a one-run defeat. Guillermo Mota gave up a tiebreaking single to Rafael Furcal in a mistake-filled, three-run sixth inning as the Giants lost 4-3 at Dodger Stadium. And Jonathan Sanchez forever lost the right to complain that spring training lasts too long. Sanchez, fresh off six weeks of tedious fielding practice, allowed the tying run to score in the sixth when he failed to scoop a 45-foot dribbler from pinch hitter Hector Gimenez - the Giants' second error in the inning. Third baseman Pablo Sandoval also contributed an errant throw, mistakes that nullified the euphoria of Belt's first major league home run. \"\"No, this is not how we thought we'd open here,\"\" said Giants manager Bruce Bochy, asked about those five errors. \"\"We shot ourselves in the foot. It's that simple. \"\"... Are we discouraged? No. It's early. There's no excuse, but these guys have worked hard. We're just getting in rush mode when we don't have to.\"\" The way Sanchez was missing bats, it looked as if Belt's homer would stand up. The left-hander topped 200 strikeouts a year ago, and he had tremendous stuff in his debut, using his change-up and splitter to strike out eight in the first five innings. He made one early mistake in the third to Matt Kemp, who hit a ground-rule double that scored a run. But Kemp's daring hustle ignited the Dodgers' rally in the sixth. He hit a leadoff single and didn't stop sprinting when Marcus Thames sent a hit-and-run grounder to Sandoval. Kemp advanced to third as Sandoval threw across the diamond, positioning him to score on James Loney's sacrifice fly. The Giants collapsed from there. Rod Barajas hit a two-out single, and the Dodgers spent the rest of the inning exploiting an innocuous looking patch of grass between the mound and third base. First, Aaron Miles hit a nubber that Sandoval barehanded but threw offline to first base, putting runners at second and third. Then Gimenez managed a tapper that Sanchez (0-1) fumbled as Barajas scored the tying run. Sanchez became excited when Gimenez provided the grounder he needed to escape with the lead. A little too excited. \"\"I went too fast, and I just missed it,\"\" Sanchez said. \"\"That cost us the game.\"\" It cost Sanchez a victory, too, and the baseball. Furcal greeted Mota with a line drive to right field that put the Dodgers ahead. In Thursday's opener, Belt had the best at-bats in the afternoon shadows against Clayton Kershaw, seeing 27 pitches over his four plate appearances. The rookie saw the ball even better against Chad Billingsley, bringing new meaning to the term, \"\"belt-high fastball\"\" while crushing a 2-0 pitch that gave the Giants a 3-1 lead. Belt held a serious countenance as he sprinted down the line and didn't change his expression as teammates greeted him with helmet slaps and high fives. It wasn't until he visited the bat rack and braced himself for a bear hug from Sandoval that Belt broke into a huge smile. He told Sandoval that he felt as if he were dreaming. \"\"It doesn't feel like I'm here right now,\"\" said Belt, soberly. \"\"But it's tough when you don't pull out a win. \"\"I hit that ball well. Then I thought, \"\"Oh my, he might catch it.\"\" It looked like a wall scraper from where I was.\"\" In case anyone is wondering, no National League club has produced consecutive rookie of the year winners since the Dodgers collected five trophies (Mike Piazza, Eric Karros, Raul Mondesi, Hideo Nomo, Todd Hollandsworth) from 1992-96. It was not a wonderful night for the reigning NL rookie, though. Buster Posey rolled over an outside pitch while grounding into a double play in the first inning, then flicked his bat into the stands while striking out to strand the bases loaded in the seventh. Jonathan Broxton, who lost his job as the Dodgers\"\" closer last season, pitched the ninth to protect a one-run victory for the second consecutive night. ' \n",

Jayawardene's 14th one-day hundred steered Sri Lanka to 274-6 after skipper Kumar Sangakkara won an important toss and elected to bat on a slow wicket that hampered stroke-making. Tailenders Nuwan Kulasekara (32 off 30 balls) and Thisara Perera (22 off nine) helped Sri Lanka smash 63 runs in the last five overs of power-play to leave India chasing 5.50 runs an over under lights. Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men will begin their reply knowing that seven of the previous nine World Cup finals have been lost by the team batting second. A sell-out crowd of 33,000, including Indian President Pratibha Patil and Sri Lanka's head of state Mahinda Rajapakse, watched an absorbing contest between bat and ball. India's left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan dried up the flow of runs at the start and his two wickets made him the tournament's leading bowler alongside Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi with 21 wickets each. Confusion reigned at the toss, which had to be performed twice after match referee Jeff Crowe did not hear Sangakkara's call when Dhoni threw up the coin. Zaheer opened with three successive maidens and then struck with the first ball of his fourth over when Virender Sehwag dived to his right in the slips to remove Upul Tharanga for two. Fast bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth lifted the pressure by conceding 15 runs in his fifth over that included a no-ball and a warning for running in the danger area in his follow-through. Sreesanth, who was preferred ahead of spinner Ravichandran Ashwin after Ashish Nehra was ruled out with a fractured finger, was thrashed for 52 runs in his eight overs. Tillakaratne Dilshan, going into the final as the tournament's leading scorer with 467 runs, made 33 when he was bowled by off-spinner Harbhajan Singh to make Sri Lanka 60-2 in the 17th over. Sangakkara and Jayawardene put on 62 for the third wicket in 68 balls when Yuvraj Singh broke through by having the skipper caught behind by wicket-keeper Dhoni for 48. Thilan Samaraweera (21) added 57 for the fourth wicket with Jayawardene when he was given out leg-before through a TV referral after umpire Simon Taufel had negated bowler Yuvraj's appeal. Star spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, who was declared fit to play despite niggling hamstring and knee injuries, will lead the Sri Lanka attack with sling-arm fast bowler Lasith Malinga.

Wayne Rooney struck a second-half hat-trick as Manchester United came from two goals down to beat West Ham 4-2 and strengthen their position at the top of the Premier League. Mark Noble had scored twice from the penalty spot at Upton Park but the hosts felt Nemanja Vidic should have been dismissed by referee Lee Mason for denying Demba Ba a goalscoring opportunity. United took full advantage in the second half, with Rooney pulling a goal back before levelling with his 100th league goal for his club. The England striker then established a lead with a penalty after Matthew Upson's handball, before Javier Hernandez grabbed another. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson watched the match unfold from the stands as he is serving a touchline ban for criticising referee Martin Atkinson. After 10 minutes another decision went against his team when the hosts took the lead through Noble's first penalty, after a move that started on the edge of West Ham's penalty area. Thomas Hitzlsperger's long pass out of defence released Carlton Cole, whose attempt to lob the ball over Patrice Evra resulted in the France international handling. Noble kept his nerve and sent Tomasz Kuszczak the wrong way to establish a lead, then doubled the advantage in the 25th minute with another spot-kick. Mason's decision for the second penalty may have angered Ferguson, as Vidic was certain his challenge on Cole came outside the area. The Serbia international even pointed to the precise area he had made the tackle as Cole danced in from the left, but Mason had already made his decision. Noble went for power with his second penalty, and in the opposite corner, with his finish angling into the roof of the net. United were inevitably going to see more of the ball as they chased the game, but their first sight of goal led to an athletic save from Robert Green. West Ham manager Avram Grant could not understand why Green did not play for England against Ghana in Tuesday's friendly at Wembley following his recent good form. He produced a fine stop to deny Park Ji-Sung when the midfielder was left unmarked and unleashed a powerful volley. United also felt they should have had a penalty when Rooney's poor control saw the ball flick up and strike Upson on the arm. Vidic, though, was thankful for Mason's leniency when he was only given a yellow card when he prevented Ba from racing through on goal. Hitzlsperger flashed the resulting free-kick just wide. Hernandez was brought on at the half-time interval, with Ryan Giggs moved to left-back as United looked to get back into the game. Rooney pulled a goal back with a spectacular curling free-kick 25 yards from goal after Noble had fouled Michael Carrick in the 65th minute, giving United momentum heading into the final phase of the game. Rooney then levelled the match when he collected Antonio Valencia's pass, raced past Manuel Da Costa and fired his finish beyond Green. Dimitar Berbatov, on as a substitute, forced two saves from Green but it was Rooney who grabbed the lead for them, tucking away his penalty after Upson handled Fabio da Silva's cross. Giggs crossed for Hernandez to tap in with six minutes remaining to add gloss to the scoreline. ' \n",

The victory saw United stretch their lead at the top of the table to eight points ahead of Arsenal's match against Blackburn in Saturday's late kick-off. United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his side had shown championship-winning pedigree by coming back to take all three points. West Ham had looked to be on course for a deserved victory after two early penalties from Mark Noble fired the Londoners into a 2-0 lead at Upton Park against a woeful United side. But Rooney spearheaded a dramatic United transformation in the second half, curling in a superb free-kick on 65 minutes to throw the leaders a lifeline before levelling with a rasping low shot eight minutes later. The comeback was complete on 78 minutes when fullback Fabio Da Silva charged down the right flank and whipped a ball back into the box. The Brazilian's pull back grazed West Ham defender Matthew Upson on the arm and referee Lee Mason had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Rooney duly stepped up to slam in the penalty before substitute Javier Hernandez completed the scoring with a close range effort on 84 minutes. Defeat was desperately hard on the Hammers, who had protested angrily after Mason failed to send off United captain Nemanja Vidic. The Serbian defender was lucky to stay on the pitch after hauling down Demba Ba shortly before half-time, receiving only a yellow card instead. A few minutes into the second half Vidic again breathed a sigh of relief after escaping a second yellow for a clumsy tackle from behind on Ba.

Connecticut, which faces Kentucky in the Final Four on Saturday, was penalized by the NCAA in February for recruiting violations involving Miles and other infractions. Calhoun was cited by the NCAA for failing to create an atmosphere of compliance within the program and suspended for the first three Big East games of the 2011-12 season. Miles, who was expelled from UConn in October 2008 without ever playing for the Huskies, refused to participate in the investigation. In a story posted on The New York Times' website Friday night, Miles said he \"\"probably\"\" would be open to talking to the NCAA now to \"\"get some things straight.\"\" NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn said the organization made several attempts to contact Miles during its investigation. \"\"During these efforts, it was made clear Nate was not going to talk to us,\"\" Osburn said. \"\"If new information comes to light, the next step is to assess its credibility and determine if further steps are needed.\"\" Miles disputed several aspects of Calhoun's account of his recruitment. Miles said former UConn assistant Tom Moore introduced him to Josh Nochimson, and the former team manager provided shoes and clothes, along with $250 every three days once Miles committed to the Huskies.

The federation said Saturday that it would look into the incident at the start of the week. St. Pauli faces a fine and could also be ordered to play a home game without spectators. The police identified the fan who threw the cup and detained him, according to St. Pauli’s security chief, Sven Brux. The fan was not identified.

The linesman Thorsten Schiffner was struck and fell to the ground but was unhurt. The referee Deniz Aytekin decided to end the game after consulting with Schiffner. “It’s always sad when a game ends before time,” Aytekin said. “But we had to call off the game. There was no other choice.” He pointed out that coins and lighters had also been thrown at Schiffner, who had to be examined by a doctor. “That’s totally unacceptable, it’s not tolerated and I can only apologize to the linesman,” St. Pauli Coach Holger Stanislawski said. “We can swear on the bench, on the field you can play hard, but if you throw things, you are endangering others.” It was the seventh game in Bundesliga history to be suspended, the federation said.

Birmingham City catapulted themselves out of the Premier League relegation zone with victory over Bolton Wanderers at St Andrew's. Veteran Birmingham striker Kevin Phillips made the most of being handed his first league start of the season by opening the scoring in the fourth minute, the 37-year-old meeting Sebastian Larsson's corner and unleashing an effort that Jussi Jaaskelainen could not stop going in. Craig Gardner made it 2-0 just before the hour mark with a strike that crashed in off the post and although Johan Elmander's reply for Wanderers set up a tense finale, the hosts hung on for three vital points. The win moves Alex McLeish's team, who had started the day 19th in the table, up five places, although they remain only two points above the drop zone. Birmingham appeared keen to make amends for their 3-2 home defeat to Bolton in the FA Cup quarter-final just three weeks earlier and having made a lively start, they took an early lead. Gardner won a corner with a deflected shot and Larsson's delivery skimmed over the head of Roger Johnson before falling to Phillips, who rifled the ball in off Jaaskelainen. Gardner tried his luck from outside the box three minutes later but his drive went across goal and wide. Almost immediately, Elmander had a chance at the other end on the turn which he was unable to get much power on, Ben Foster collecting the ball comfortably. Daniel Sturridge then cut into the box after finding some space only to blaze off target. Lee Bowyer volleyed over in the 25th minute having received a bouncing ball across the area from Larsson and the Sweden winger then teed up Gardner, who struck wide from distance. Bolton looked dangerous whenever they broke forward and after Sturridge had made weak contact with a header towards goal, he fired in a far more potent effort from the edge of the box which Foster got down to block. The England goalkeeper then held on to a deflected shot from Elmander before seeing Kevin Davies lift the ball over the bar. The hosts were soaking up a lot of pressure, but had a great chance to make it 2-0 in the 39th minute when Cameron Jerome raced on to a long ball. He appeared set to stroke it past Jaaskelainen, but fluffed his lines and the opportunity was wasted. Wanderers hit back again, with Sturridge bringing two more saves out of Foster, the second particularly impressive on the part of the Blues stopper as he pushed away a low, fierce strike from the on-loan Chelsea frontman. Jaaskelainen then jumped to catch a header from Johnson in first half stoppage time. Birmingham thought they had doubled their advantage three minutes after the restart but were denied by the assistant referee's flag, Jaaskelainen parrying Phillips' shot, the ball being headed back across goal and Larsson having his effort disallowed for offside. Sturridge continued to cause problems for the Blues with another shot from the edge of the area, but soon after it was Jerome shaping to shoot, Gretar Steinsson just getting in to nod the ball away. From the resulting corner, Jerome set up Johnson, whose attempt was pushed around the post in fine style by Jaaskelainen. Four minutes later, though, the hosts had a second goal as Gardner played a delightful one-two with Jerome before slamming the ball beyond Jaaskelainen and in off the post. McLeish shuffled his pack, introducing Keith Fahey and David Bentley for Bowyer and Stephen Carr, but with 20 minutes remaining, Bolton got themselves back in the game. Skipper Davies chested the ball down for Elmander, who leapt to connect with it and power into the net. Wanderers boss Owen Coyle, who had already brought on Lee Chung-yong for Tamir Cohen, added further attacking options from the bench in the shape of Ivan Klasnic and Matthew Taylor for Martin Petrov and Fabrice Muamba, while McLeish did likewise by throwing on top scorer Nikola Zigic for Jerome. Bolton's search for an equaliser showed little sign of bearing fruit until the dying moments, when Birmingham were once again indebted to the efforts of their goalkeeper. Foster first tipped a backwards header from Davies behind for a corner, and then produced an even better save to push Steinsson's header over the bar. There was time for one last nodded effort by Gary Cahill before the final whistle which Sturridge could not stretch to reach. ' \n",

I like him. He's a fantastic striker, but I do not want to change. And I am sure Sir Alex does not want any changes either. We have the best group of forwards in the Premier League. I am happy with these strikers, and I do not want to swap them with anybody,\"\" the Daily Express quoted Ancelotti as saying. Ancelotti has a strong strike-force in Didier Drogba, Nicolas Anelka, Salomon Kalou and Fernando Torres. Despite this, as Chelsea head to Stoke today, needing to win all their nine league games in order to retain their League title, none of the four strikers have scored in the last two months, since Torres joined the team from Liverpool. However, Chelsea has managed to get by, having lost only once in their past eight games in the league, thanks to goals from their midfield, Frank Lampard. Chelsea takes on United next week in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final, with Ancelotti demanding a better performance from his strikers. \"\"You don't lose that ability to score. If you are a top scorer, you'll stay like that until the end of your career. It comes back,\"\" he said. Ancelotti has long maintained that the nine point gap between his team and Ferguson's United is too great to contemplate overtaking and winning a second straight title. However, Chelsea players claim that a title charge is back on now after their recent revival. ' \n",

The game’s first-half was definitely a counter-attacking affair, with both sides looking to open the scoring on the break, with Everton most certainly the brighter of the two. Both teams were showing a mix of determination and energy, despite the midweek internationals and were putting on a good show for the spectators at Goodison. The hosts took lead after tremendous running and footwork by midfielder Leon Osman saw the Toffees secure a first-half advantage. However, it didn’t last long with Darren Bent getting two goals in the second-half, the second coming after a controversially disallowed goal from Jermaine Beckford that appeared to cross the line. Leighton Baines had to save David Moyes’ blushes from the penalty spot to keep hopes alive of a top-half finish. The home side were without the prowess of French striker Louis Saha, who will be facing the rest of the season on the sidelines after surgery on his ankle, leaving Beckford to take the striking duties on his own. Jack Rodwell and Tim Cahill were also ruled out through injury, but youngster Seamus Coleman passed a late fitness test and started the game. Villa were glad to see James Collins and Richard Dunne return to their defensive line-up, however, Ciaran Clark was still suspended. Everton began the game in a positive manner, putting on early pressure to show their intentions towards Gerard Houllier’s side, winning an early free kick around 20-yards outside the Villa area. John Heitinga stepped up to the set-piece, but didn’t even pass the Villa wall and the ball was cleared to safety. Just minutes later, Beckford was put on goal, much to his surprise, by a stray back-header that was meant for Brad Friedel. However, the former Leeds man couldn’t get it past Villa’s American ‘keeper and pushed the angled shot out for a corner. The following set piece also tested the former Liverpool shot stopper, after Leighton Baines swung in the ball, eventually falling for Coleman whose effort was blasted straight down the middle of goal, forcing Friedel to save with his feet. Regardless of their own spirit within the game, Villa were only able to threaten Tim Howard’s net through a succession of corners with Dunne going the closest with a header, but the effort could only manage to past the outside of the ‘keeper’s right-post. On his 10-year anniversary for the Toffees, Tony Hibbert was repaying the faith through a solid defensive display, showcasing his experience with a shot-stopping block on a Nigel Reo-Coker effort, ensuring that Everton would not be the first to go behind in what was becoming an end-to-end battle. The deadlock was finally broken after a non-stop 38 minutes with Osman putting the hosts ahead. Working the ball down the left, teammate Diniyar Bilyaletdinov allowed Osman to collect the ball in his stride. Using a combination of pace and delicate footwork, he was able to out-maneuver the Villa defenders and place the ball past Friedel, enabling Everton to go in at half-time with a one goal lead. However, the Toffee’s lead didn’t even last three minutes of the second-half. Stewart Downing cutting inside the right channel allowed himself to find some space on the edge of the area and unchallenged, was able to place the ball towards the penalty spot where a waiting and unmarked Darren Bent was able to power his foot through the pass, causing the ball to fly into the top right-hand corner of Howard’s net. Howard didn’t help Everton’s cause after a moment of madness when the American came rushing out to challenge Bent, but the ‘keeper could only manage to foul the England international. The resulting set-piece could have led to an immediate second for Villa if Kyle Walker had kept his volleyed effort from inside the area down. Just a few minutes later, Everton found themselves asking why they hadn’t regained the lead after a corner from the right found an unmarked Heitinga leaving the Dutchman with a free header on goal, but Friedel found some inspiring luck to save the shot with his own head. Osman tried to follow up the effort, however, his contribution wasn’t so accurate and drifted wide of the net. Football showed its how punishing it could be after Beckford was out through on goal for Everton and deciding to shoot from just inside the box, the ball smacked against the woodwork and appeared to cross the line. However, didn’t see it that way, nor did his assistants. Friedel’s following goal kick was quickly taken and through a succession of rapid passing, Bent was through on goal at the other end and the former Sunderland man was able to trickle the ball past Howard to put Villa 2-1 up amidst a shadow of controversy. David Moyes’ team was saved from taking nothing away from a game they had put so much effort into after John Ill Makoun brought down Phill Jagielka just inside the box following a spirited run from the England center-half. Baines stood up to the spot to take the equalizing chance and did so in clinical fashion, powering the ball past Friedel. A flurry of chances at the end for Everton couldn’t help them take all the points from the game, a succession of corners tested Friedel until the end, but to no avail and both managers had to settle for the draw.

Chelsea, in third place, needed a 33rd-minute header by Didier Drogba to escape with a draw against a club in the middle of the standings. Rooney's first hat trick in 14 months allowed Man United to bounce back from a 2-0 halftime deficit, boosting their chances for a record 19th English championship. \"\"We played like champions,\"\" United manager Alex Ferguson said. \"\"It was a real championship performance as far as I'm concerned.\"\" Liverpool, which shares the record of 18 titles with United, lost 2-1 against a West Bromwich Albion team led by its former manager, Roy Hodgson.

LOUIS (AP) - The St. Louis Cardinals decided not to put Matt Holliday on the disabled list Saturday, opting to wait a few days to see if the slugger can make a speedy return from an appendectomy. The left fielder had the surgery Friday but the team believes the condition was caught early and he could be back before the end of a 15-day DL stint. Manager Tony La Russa said the team would wait until Monday or Tuesday, hinting that Holliday might even stop by Busch Stadium on Saturday. \"\"They're saying it went well,\"\" La Russa said. \"\"That's all I know so far.\"\" David Freese took Holliday's cleanup spot against San Diego Padres left-hander Clayton Richard, and Allen Craig played in left field.

Albert Pujols said he spoke with Holliday before the laparoscopic procedure and was optimistic he'd be back soon. \"\"Obviously, his presence is going to be missed,\"\" Pujols said. \"\"When you look at that lineup, you're expecting Matt to be there, and he won't be there probably for the next week or so.\"\" Craig, who was batting sixth, and Jon Jay will get the bulk of the playing time.

The result touched off wild celebrations across India and gave the great Sachin Tendulkar his first title in six attempts. Tendulkar, the greatest batsman in cricket, was lifted onto his teammates' shoulders for a victory lap at Wankhede Stadium. \"\"It's the ultimate thing and I'm experiencing it,\"\" he said. \"\"I couldn't have asked for anything better. It's the proudest moment of my life.\"\" Tendulkar was out for 18, unable to produce his 100th international century on his home ground. Still, his teammates dedicated the victory to him. \"\"He carried the hopes of the nation for 21 years so it's time we carried him on our shoulders,\"\" batsman Virat Kohli said. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni scored an unbeaten 91, sharing a 109-run stand with Gautam Gambhir (97) and finishing with a giant six. India chased down Sri Lanka 274-6 and became the first team to win batting second in a final since Sri Lanka beat Australia by eight wickets in 1996. Australia won the three previous World Cups - 1999, 2003 and 2007. The 37-year-old Tendulkar, the leading run scorer in international cricket, praised those around him. \"\"It's never too late as they say. Thanks to all my teammates. Without such fabulous performance and such consistency it would never have happened,\"\" he said, adding he was brought to tears. \"\"They were happy tears, so I wouldn't mind crying.\"\" Tendulkar was drenched in champagne by his teammates as the Indian squad carried the trophy around the stadium amid a scrum of cameras and fireworks blazing from the roof. There was traffic chaos on the adjoining Marine Parade, with the road jammed with cars and motor bikes honking horns, waving Indian flags and letting off firecrackers. Yuvraj Singh, who scored an unbeaten 21 in an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership with Dhoni, was voted player of the series. \"\"This is unbelievable. This is the most special one for whole of India, for Sachin, for the whole team. It's just amazing. We batted like champions.\"\" Sangakkara said he was proud of the way his Sri Lankans pushed the tournament favorites to the limit, in the closest final since 1992. \"\"I'm very proud of everyone, especially Mahela Jayawardene who rose to the occasion with a great hundred,\"\" he said. \"\"It's been a great tournament for us. \"\"I must say the way India played they really deserved the tag of favorites.\"\" There was no winning farewell to international cricket for Muttiah Muralitharan, the only survivor from Sri Lanka's 1996 winning squad. Muralitharan, the leading wicket taker in international cricket, was slowed by injuries. He did not have the spring he needs for the extra spin that has bamboozled batsmen for a generation. The result also made Mahela Jayawardene the first batsmen to score a century in a World Cup final and end up on a losing team. The match tilted twice, with India on top at the start before some late hitting led by Jayawardene. Lasith Malinga removed both Indian openers in an express pace opening spell to keep the visitors on track, but India's long batting lineup remained calm enough to keep grinding the target down. Jayawardene finished in a tie for the leading wicket taker in the tournament with 21. However, his last figures of 2-60 after his first five overs cost him just six runs. The Sri Lankans scored 63 runs in the last five overs in a batting power play, including 24 in the last nine balls. The match started amid confusion when the referee ordered a second coin toss because he couldn't hear Sangakkara's call. Sangakkara won the second toss, a rarity in the international game, and was relieved to be batting first. ' \n",

United swept back from 2-0 down at half-time to beat West Ham 4-2, going seven points clear at the top of the table. Rooney scored the first with a free-kick, finished crisply for the second and converted a penalty for his hat-trick. Javier Hernandez, on as a substitute, added the fourth. “We played like champions,” said Sir Alex Ferguson. “We didn’t lose faith in ability and that was important. It is not an easy place to come here, with them fighting relegation and at 2-0 down we were under the cosh. It was a real championship performance.” Ferguson conceded that Nemanja Vidic had enjoyed “a lucky break” when he was shown just a yellow card in the first half for pulling back Demba Ba when the last defender, but took issue with Lee Mason’s award of the second penalty against United. “It was outside the box,” he said. While Rooney delivered a superb performance his celebration of the third goal, when he was clearly picked up shouting “ - off” by the pitch-side camera, caused considerable embarrassment to the broadcasters, who apologised to viewers immediately. Rooney also said sorry for the outburst, which came just days after Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore had demanded that the Respect campaign was better observed. He said: “I want to apologise for any offence that may have been caused, especially any parents or children watching. Emotions were running high and on reflection my heat-of-the-moment reaction was inappropriate. It was not aimed at anyone in particular.” An FA spokesman confirmed the governing body would “look at” the incident. Rooney could be charged with bringing the game into disrepute, although that is unlikely. It is not the first-time Rooney has got in trouble with pitch-side cameras. After England’s 0-0 draw with Algeria in last year’s World Cup, he directed a foul-mouthed tirade into a camera at fans who were booing the team off the pitch. ' \n",

Sharapova was the soprano, Azarenka the alto, and their alternating arias could be heard on the beach across the street from the Sony Ericsson Open. But Sharapova was flat and her opponent sharp. Azarenka swept nine consecutive games to take charge Saturday and won the tournament for the second time, beating Sharapova, 6-1, 6-4. The final matched two of the most notorious grunters in tennis, and while both were noisy, Azarenka's shots had more bang. Sharapova committed 43 unforced errors, held serve only once and came up short with a late comeback bid. \"\"I played real well the first set,\"\" the No. 8-seeded Azarenka said. \"\"Maria is such a great fighter, I knew she was going to fight to the end. She came up with great tennis at the end, and I had to hang in there. That's what paid off.\"\" And who had the better shriek? \"\"I think mine is quieter,\"\" Azarenka said. Sharapova committed eight errors in the first game alone. She lined one especially unsightly serve into the concrete in front of the net. By the time she found her range, Azarenka led 4-love in the second set. \"\"It's a little bit too late to pick up the pace when you're down a set and 4-love,\"\" Sharapova said. \"\"I wish I picked it up earlier, obviously. She did many things better than I did today.\"\" While the women's tournament was full of surprises, the men's draw is down to the game's top-ranked players. No. 1 Rafael Nadal will play for the championship Sunday against No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who is 23-0 this year. Sharapova lost in a final for the fourth time since her most recent title, at Strasbourg in May 2010. She's 0-3 in finals at Key Biscayne, where she was also the runner-up in 2005 and 2006. But the three-time Grand Slam champion is healthy again after battling a series of injuries, as the results are starting to show. She's projected to climb next week to No. 9, the highest she has been ranked since early 2009. \"\"It means that I'm winning matches, and winning more of them,\"\" she said. \"\"It has been a long road to get here. It's not over yet.\"\" Azarenka's also on the rise, and projected to be ranked No. 6 next week, matching a career-best. Alas, the 21-year-old Belarussian can't play Key Biscayne every week. She also won the tournament in 2009, stopping Serena Williams in the final. The two titles are the biggest of her career, and she joked she's planning to move to Miami from Minsk. Serena and Venus Williams, who between them have won eight Key Biscayne titles, missed the tournament for health reasons. But Azarenka still faced a tough path to the final, beating No. 2 Kim Clijsters and No. 3 Vera Zvonareva in straight sets. Through six rounds, Azarenka avoided the sort of emotional outbursts that derailed her in the past. She said that after losing in the third round at Dubai in February, she went home and reflected on the state of her game. \"\"I changed my mentality a little bit,\"\" she said. \"\"I'm enjoying myself so much on the court that there's no room for me for frustration. I just don't care if I lose - what I mean is not to create such a big drama out of it. If you lose the match, it's not the end of the world.\"\" Before facing Sharapova, Azarenka suggested fans wear earplugs, and the two finalists went at it like a couple of \"\"Aida\"\" rejects. The screeching on one early exchange had spectators giggling before the point ended, but a grim Sharapova pretended not to notice the strident soundtrack. \"\"I don't really think about it when I play,\"\" she said. \"\"It's about thinking what I have to do.\"\" She had trouble there, with Azarenka hitting aggressively from the baseline to prevent Sharapova from finding her rhythm. Sharapova broke serve to reach 1-all, but it was an hour before she won another game. She failed to convert 11 game points on her serve before holding for the only time to trail 4-2, and briefly steadied her strokes. Pounding winners, she overcame two match points to break for 5-4. \"\"I didn't feel like I was doing anything wrong,\"\" Azarenka said. \"\"She was just playing really good.\"\" But Sharapova was too erratic to sustain her rally - or the rallies. When she dumped a forehand into the net on the final point, Azarenka dropped her racket in disbelief and celebrated by spinning and dancing across the court. And then the only noise came from the cheering crowd. ' \n",

The Manchester United striker was not playing particularly well before the pivotal 63rd minute of this game, and neither were his team-mates, even if West Ham's two-goal lead did flatter the east London club. What then transpired in a 15-minute spell demonstrated all of Rooney's considerable qualities. Perhaps inevitably, he went on to sully it with his expletive into a TV camera. But while his capacity to be a role model will always be dubious at best, his football ability is less in doubt. United's title challenge was faltering here yesterday. Trailing to two penalties, they looked unconvincing even against a distinctly shaky West Ham side. Indeed, even if United go on to glory, it will be difficult to escape the conclusion that they would be the least inspiring of Sir Alex Ferguson's 12 Premier League title teams. However, in terms of sheer belligerence and indefatigability, they are unsurpassed. \"\"Going for it is important to our club and we played like champions,\"\" said Ferguson. \"\"We kept our heads up and we didn't lose faith in our ability.\"\" He was right, of course. This United side have no concept of being beaten, even on a day when Nemanja Vidic was doing his utmost to remove himself from the shortlists for player-of-the-season awards, his lax positioning and state of seemingly permanent panic infecting Chris Smalling and Patrice Evra. Only when a bright new left-back prospect was introduced at half-time in place of Evra did United's defence steady. His name? Ryan Giggs. \"\"Once we polish him up a bit he'll be OK,\"\" joked Ferguson. In fact, asked to play a new position at 37, Giggs performed so well he might consider adding a few seasons to his career as a defender. As for West Ham, they will take heart from a well-executed start to the game, rather than the abject surrender by the finish. \"\"You don't count on a win against Manchester United, even if we wanted to win it,\"\" said manager Avram Grant. \"\"The other games are more important.\"\" Despite starting brightly, with Smalling heading over after four minutes, United capitulated in unusual fashion. When Scott Parker launched a hopeful long ball on 11 minutes, every schoolboy could have told Vidic and Smalling that it should have been met with a firm clearing header. Instead, it bounced and Carlton Cole flicked the ball up against Evra's hand. Referee Lee Mason pointed to the appropriate spot and Mark Noble dispatched the penalty confidently, low to his left. In 25 minutes was invited to try again. Cole, displaying uncommon confidence, sold a dummy and raced past Vidic, only to be felled by the Serbia defender. The first foul was just outside the area, but so marginal that it was difficult for anyone but Vidic to berate the referee. Noble stepped up and this time went high and right. United's season was in jeopardy. Despite Rob Green having to parry away a Ji-Sung Park shot, West Ham had found their stride. Thomas Hitzlsperger sliced wide before Vidic failed to deal with yet another long ball on 42 minutes. As Demba Ba wriggled away, the defender wrestled him to the ground. A yellow card was produced, presumably because the ball was bouncing towards Tomasz Kuszczak, standing in for groin strain victim Edwin van der Sar. Vidic survived that potential sending-off but when he felled Ba on 49 minutes, a second yellow seemed inevitable. It never came. Even when Rooney lined up a free-kick on the edge of the area on 63 minutes, there had been little indication as to where the inspiration for a United comeback might come from. But it would have been difficult to strike the shot any better - just above the wall and high into the top right-hand corner - and as the ball struck the net, the premature optimism of Upton Park deflated instantaneously. On 72 minutes, Antonio Valencia's ball found Rooney and with his first touch he took out a posse of defenders; with his second he lashed it into the net. Now there was no doubt about where this game was going. Fabio da Silva flicked the ball past Frederic Piquionne on 78 minutes and avoided an ill-advised lunge from Matthew Upson, who then handled Fabio's pass from the touchline. Rooney's penalty found the corner and he embarked on his ill-judged celebration. There was still time for Javier Hernandez to bolster his burgeoning reputation with a goal from close range on 84 minutes from a deflected Giggs cross. ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Simon Hughes: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni timed entire World Cup campaign to perfection One of the many extensively played commercials during this World Cup features the Indian team making profound statements. “Play without fear!” recommends Sachin Tendulkar. His captain MS Dhoni is the definition of that. Unfazed by a highest score in the tournament of just 34, he promoted himself to No 5 and strode to the crease with the match in the balance at 114-3. With total conviction and complete self-assurance he clipped and chipped, occasionally carved, and ultimately clubbed, his side to handsome victory with a massive six over long on to finish 91 not out. The prolific Tendulkar may be India’s national treasure but Dhoni is their modern icon. Dhoni is Mr Confident. But even more so he is Mr Cool. He exudes a kind of karma under the most intense stress. You see it everywhere. Behind the stumps, in press conferences, at the crease. He has a sort of disarming presence that puts everyone at ease. It is this that has allowed this talented Indian team to truly flourish. He dissipates pressure. He, and departing coach Gary Kirsten, have created an environment which has enabled India to conquer the world. He is individual and unflappable. He doesn’t play by the rules. He encourages everyone to be themselves. He announces unexpected selections (or non-selections) with a chuckle and a simple explanation, he unveils surprising bowling changes - Tendulkar and Virat Koli had a couple of mid-innings overs yesterday - and he suddenly rejigs the batting order. He has been responsible for the rejuvenation of Yuvraj Singh, India’s man of the tournament. He gave Yuvraj a key role with the ball and his confidence and prowess returned with the bat. In the most intense situation of all, with India stuttering mid-innings, he poured immediate calm on troubled waters. He took total responsibility, sidling in and setting about the task of seeing his team home. He did so in his own inimitable way. He began by dinking the ailing Muttiah Muralitharan for runs on the leg-side. He was unflustered and unhurried. At the other end Gautem Gambir was still encouraged to come down the pitch to the Sri Lankan spinners despite being out stumped against Pakistan in the semi-final, another sign of the fearless atmosphere that Dhoni has enabled. He allies quirky deflections to brute force. He bounces around the crease to work balls into gaps or jumps back to thrash Murali past cover. When he did that a second time it brought up his fifty. No-one had realised he had that many - he is not one who plays for personal glory. Perhaps that is his secret. He doesn’t measure his life by numbers. He plays for the moment, immerses himself in it. The helicopter shot - featured in another TV ad - came out just once, uppercutting a short ball from Thisara Perera over third man for the first six of the innings. He scampered unselfishly between the wickets. A smear off Nuwan Kulasekera’s attempted yorker saw the ball hit the fence to bring up 250. There was a deft tickle off Malinga’s slower ball for four, then a wristy flick of a low full toss for another. Just seven were needed. Then four. He sent the next soaring over long on to finish the job. Mahela Jayawardene had already played an exquisite innings and it would be hard to imagine a better exhibition of one-day batsmanship. But Dhoni timed India’s run chase, not to say entire campaign, to perfection. ' \n",

During those six weeks in Arizona, he pretty much played himself out of a job. After hitting just .186 during the spring, he's got new duties now: part-time player, utility man and pinch-hitter. On Saturday, he delivered as that pinch-hitter, blasting a two-run, two-out, bases-loaded double to cap a five-run eighth inning and send the Cubs past the Pittsburgh Pirates 5-3. \"\"Whatever is asked of me. Just keep playing and working,\"\" DeWitt said. \"\"It's new to me. I've had several pinch-hit opportunities in my career. I'm not going to say a lot. I've done it before, so I have a decent idea of how to get ready.\"\" Chicago's comeback against relievers Evan Meek and Chris Resop was aided by a costly error on Pirates first baseman Lyle Overbay that made three of Chicago's runs in the eighth unearned. \"\"We finally put an inning together. Good for Blake DeWitt, it's a huge hit for him and for us,\"\" said Cubs manager Mike Quade, who got his first win as a full-time skipper. Cubs starter Carlos Zambrano left the game in the seventh with cramping in his right hand, one batter after he'd given up a leadoff homer to Garrett Jones that gave the Pirates a 3-0 lead. \"\"Just a cramp, but I'll be OK. Drink a lot of fluids and do what I have to do,\"\" said Zambrano, who's had cramping issues previously in his career. Zambrano said he began to cramp in his hamstring as he ran to the mound to start the seventh. After giving up the homer, Zambrano had a 2-2 count on Ronny Cedeno but couldn't continue. Sean Marshall (1-0) got the victory with a scoreless eighth and Carlos Marmol pitched the ninth for his first save. Pirates starter Paul Maholm pitched 6 2-3 shutout innings, giving up five hits, before the Cubs got to the Pirates\"\" bullpen. \"\"We had the game and let it get away from us. But you know what? I'll hand the ball to Meek every time, and all those guys in the bullpen. Everybody is going to have bad outings,\"\" Maholm said. Chicago finally broke through as Meek (0-1) walked pinch-hitter Kosuke Fukudome and threw a wild pitch before Starlin Castro hit an RBI double to make it 3-1. Overbay then misplayed Marlon Byrd's grounder for an error as Castro scored to make it 3-2. Geovany Soto had a one-out single and Alfonso Soriano singled to right-center on a 1-2 pitch to tie it at 3. Resop relieved and walked Tyler Colvin to load the bases. Dewitt then doubled to left as Wrigley Field erupted. \"\"With the bases loaded, you know he's got to come at you with strikes,\"\" DeWitt said. \"\"I put a good swing on it and came through.\"\" After losing the opener to the Pirates 6-3 when they let a 2-0 lead slip away, the Cubs were comforted by a comeback of their own. \"\"You fall behind 3-0 and with the loss yesterday you get behind late in the game like that you can roll over and quit or keep battling,\"\" DeWitt said. \"\"It definitely helps create an identity to this ball club, that we're going to give it all for nine (innings). And that's what happened.\"\" Meek, trying to set it up for hard-throwing closer Joel Hanrahan, took the blame. \"\"When you go out there and walk the leadoff guy, it's never a good sign. I just didn't make good pitches when I needed to. Didn't make very smart pitches, not smart locations,\"\" Meek said. \"\"I go out there every day expecting to get three outs and get them quickly. ... It's a very confident feeling, so going out there and not doing my job and not making the pitches, walking the leadoff guy, that weighs on you hard. Your team got three runs on the board, your starter did a great job and you're expected to get three outs. It just wasn't a good day for me.\"\" Zambrano was put on a suspended list last June, the day after he went on a rampage in the dugout at U.S. Cellular Field. He eventually underwent anger management counseling, and when he rejoined the team, he found his groove and went 8-0 over his final 11 starts. Zambrano, who threw 99 pitches on a cool 46-degree day, gave up five hits and three runs in his six innings plus. Zambrano walked two in the top of the first before Pedro Alvarez pulled a two-out RBI single to right to give the Pirates an early 1-0 lead. Neil Walker, who'd hit a grand slam in Pittsburgh's 6-3 season-opening victory Friday, had an RBI double in the third after Jose Tabata reached on an infield single. After Andrew McCutchen walked to put runners at first and second with no outs, Zambrano averted a big inning. He struck out Overbay and then raced to cover first and complete a double play that was started by first baseman Carlos Pena on Alvarez's broken-bat grounder. Maholm retired the first eight batters before Zambrano drove a double. NOTES: It was five degrees warmer than Friday, and was accompanied by a 12-mph wind blowing left to right. The crowd was much smaller, announced at 35,782 compared to 41,358 a day earlier ... Matt Garza, who will make his Cubs debut Sunday, spent most of Saturday leading cheers on the dugout steps while wearing sunglasses and a sweat shirt. ... Jones had a quick start last season when he hit two homers in the opener against the Dodgers. He had four homers against the Cubs last season when Pittsburgh won 10 of 15 games. ' \n",

Could Murali go out with a big bang? Or Tendulkar score his hundredth hundred and make a billion people happy? No. To both. This match wasn’t about individuals. It was about the team and it was a fantastic effort by India. Muralitharan’s last game was not great. He was flat and his bowling lacked its usual venom. Sachin fell early, leaving MS Dhoni to show the way. He had the temperament and the will to see India home. It was a marvellous, tense and thrilling performance. Tactically, it was not Dhoni’s best day as captain. His bowlers were poor in the last 10 overs. Then Virender Sehwag and Tendulkar, his big two batsmen, went early to make Sri Lanka favourites. Gautam Gambhir steadied India’s nerves playing well for his 97. But with the three off-spinners starting to spin the ball and causing problems, particularly for Gambhir, Dhoni made a brave and sensible decision to promote himself ahead of the in-form batsman Yuvraj Singh, who was eventually named man of the tournament. Dhoni, as a right hander, finds it easier than Yuvraj, who is left-handed, to play the off-spinners turning the ball but it was still a brave decision because Dhoni had made very few runs this tournament. At the start of his innings, he was careful and a little scratchy but, once into his stride, he bludgeoned the off-spinners with old-fashioned bottom-hand power and quick bat speed. Dhoni’s performance and the whole day was a great advert for 50-over cricket, especially as some countries want the next World Cup to revert to a 40-over format. Well, you can forget that now. India is the financial powerhouse of world cricket. Television stations are competing for the rights, companies are queuing up to be sponsors and now, with India as world champions, I can’t see them agreeing to change the format in the near future. The only disappointing aspect was the toss. That was a pathetic episode. My experience of 25 years playing the game and 20 years commentating tells me something definitely wasn’t right. It wasn’t in the spirit of cricket. The match referee supervises the toss for one reason: to ensure it goes smoothly and fairly. It certainly didn’t go smoothly because they had to do it twice. Dhoni and Jeff Crowe did not hear what Sangakkara called. Crowe should have done a better job and ensured Sangakkara’s call before Dhoni tossed the coin. Dhoni was there on behalf of his team trying to win the most important match for all of India. He should have made sure he heard the call. Dhoni let India down and Crowe let cricket down. That would have been a big story if India had lost the game. After Mahela Jayawardene’s hundred, that looked likely. It was a wonderful milestone but, quite frankly, he did not have to play a shot in anger until he was in his 80s. The pitch was good and all he had to do was steer the ball, angle and caress it, because much of the bowling was ineffective and lacked penetration. India gave one of their poorest bowling displays of the tournament but their best fielding. To play Sreesanth, who hadn’t bowled for six weeks since the first match of the tournament, was a hell of a gamble. When he did bowl in that first game he was absolute rubbish, spraying it all over the park and got smashed. Zaheer Khan has been one of the best bowlers of the competition but went for 56 in his last five overs by bowling too many length balls. A total of 91 came off the last 10 because India bowled length deliveries. The history of one-day cricket tells you to bowl straight yorkers and I thought Sri Lanka got 25 runs too many but then Dhoni played the innings of his life. ' \n",

Two thunderbolts from Lasith Malinga accounted for Virender Sehwag (0) and Sachin Tendulkar (18) after India set out in pursuit of a challenging target of 275. Only two sides had previously won the trophy batting second and a crowd of 33,000 at the Wankhede Stadium sat in stunned silence after Tendulkar edged a catch to a jubilant Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara behind the stumps. Tendulkar had scored centuries against England and South Africa to take his tally of international centuries to 99 and all Mumbai had been willing him to score the 100th in his native town. Malinga had other ideas after an assured start by Tendulkar, who at the age of 37 is unlikely to play in another World Cup. But Tendulkar, the ultimate team man, was just happy to be part of a winning outfit at his sixth World Cup and he was carried on the shoulders of his team mates around the ground after the best final since Pakistan beat England in 1992. \"\"He's carried the burden of the nation for 21 years so it's time we carried him on our shoulders,\"\" said Virat Kohli, summing up the feelings of a billion of his compatriots. In a reminder, if it were needed, that no individual is bigger than the team, Tendulkar's early exit gave an opportunity to Gautam Gambhir and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to take their side to victory. India became the first nation to win the event on home soil. TWO-YEAR TARGET Gambhir scored an assured 97 while Dhoni, who had looked leaden-footed throughout the tournament, recaptured his form to score an unbeaten 91, finishing the game with a theatrical six. Sri Lanka's 274 for six after Sangakkara had won the toss was largely the result of a masterly 103 not out from Mahela Jayawardene.

If the current rates of obesity and diabetes continue for another two decades, the prevalence of NAFLD in the U.S. is expected to increase by 50 percent in 2030, AAAS said. The prediction is based on pre-existing clinical survey data over a 10 year period (1988-1994, 1999-2004 and 2005-2008), which included 39,500 adults from three survey cycles, according to the AAAS. Over the three cycles, the prevalence of NAFLD doubled from 5. 51 percent to 11 percent respectively. Furthermore, during the first survey cycle (1988-1994) 46.8 percent of all CLD's was related to NAFLD but by 2005-2008 this had increased to 75.1 percent. In addition, the prevalence of obesity and diabetes, the two key risk factors for NAFLD also steadily increased. \"\"If the obesity epidemic is anything to go by, the U.S. NAFLD epidemic may have a ripple effect worldwide,\"\" said Mark Thursz, Vice Secretary of the European Association for the Study of the Liver. \"\"It is imperative that health systems continue to drive effective educational programs to reinforce awareness among the general public to alert them of the risks of obesity and promote the importance of diet and exercise.\"\" Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is fast becoming one of the top concerns for clinicians due to the obesity epidemic and it's potential to progress to advanced liver disease which significantly impacts on overall liver-related mortality, Thursz said in remarks published by AAAS' website EurekAlert.org. NAFLD, considered as one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, is the term used to describe fat build-up in liver cells in people who do not drink alcohol excessively. The disease is the most common persistent liver disorder in Western countries with an estimated overall prevalence of 20-30 percent, according to AAAS. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver disease associated with insulin resistance, diabetes and obesity and as such people most at risk of NAFLD are those who are obese, have insulin resistance associated with diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol.

Last fall they introduced a new plan to subscribers that was streaming only (no DVDs in the mail) for $7.99 a month. Their instant library has increased significantly after making deals with cable providers Starz and Showtime as well as networks such as NBC and CBS. Today, Netflix announced that they had reached a new deal with FOX to stream past seasons of current shows such as Glee and Sons of Anarchy as well as past shows like Ally McBeal and The Wonder Years . FOX programming has been available to Netflix subscribers previously with shows like 24 and Arrested Development . But the announcement of current shows being available to stream is interesting considering other entertainment providers are starting to pull their current shows from Netflix customers. It was announced a week ago that Showtime was pulling its current programing like Dexter and Californication from Netflix. Although as of today, seasons one and two of Dexter are still available to stream and season one of Californication is also available to watch online. But those shows will likely be pulled from instant-streaming once the current deal expires. \"\"Current and past seasons of our original series will be available to our authenticated subscribers via our TV Everywhere service Showtime Anytime,\"\" said a spokesperson with the company. Advertisement The new Showtime-Netflix deal will include the streaming of shows that are no longer on the network, such as The Tudors and Sleeper Cell . The announcement of this agreement comes after CBS and Netflix struck a deal to stream older CBS titles such as Star Trek , Cheers and Frasier . The deal however does not include current programming on the network. So while television providers are starting to renegotiate their deals with Netflix, movie studios are looking to strike lucrative deals to stream their back catalogs. According to The Wall Street Journal, the video service is close to making a deal with Miramax that would stream the studio's library of more than 700 films. The Journal says that Miramax has worked out a five-year deal with the video service for around $100 million to stream films like Pulp Fiction and The English Patient . So while television giants are becoming fickle with their current content, movie studios appear to be eager to join the leading video service and earn new revenue from past titles. ' \n",

Google has finally gotten fed up with the humiliating alterations its Android operating system has been subjected to by wireless carriers. So says a Bloomberg Businessweek story by Ashlee Vance and Peter Burrows that reports on a new set of rules Google will enforce on mobile partners who want the equivalent of most-favored-nation status. “There will be no more willy-nilly tweaks to the software. No more partnerships formed outside of Google’s purview. From now on, companies hoping to receive early access to Google’s most up-to-date software will need approval of their plans.” The story reported that the Mountain View, Calif., company was requiring that other firms licensing its Linux-based operating system sign “non-fragmentation clauses” to grant it veto power over their tweaks to the operating system. Having seen many of these tweaks - from harmless but sometimes unappreciated alterations such as Samsung and HTC’s TouchWiz and Sense overlays to outright mutilations of Android, such as Verizon’s excruciating Samsung Fascinate, which hard-wired its search button to Microsoft’s Bing - I have no problem with Google’s change of heart. The users I hear from don’t want any more extras from those companies. As Windows PC buyers have said for years, they want to be able to choose a clean, uncluttered configuration of the standard operating system. That’s what I loved about the Nexus S phone I reviewed late last year. And that’s why some Android users, myself included, have taken the radical step of installing a third-party build of Android to replace the limited, carrier-installed version. This is a risk I worried about when Google announced Android. My column at the time emphasized the benefits of Android’s openness to users but fretted that carriers “could always choose to revise it to lock out any tinkering by their customers.” It’s true that Google promised something different at Android’s launch. Its Nov. 5, 2007, press release states that “the Android platform will be made available under one of the most progressive, developer-friendly open-source licenses, which gives mobile operators and device manufacturers significant freedom and flexibility to design products.” But Google has always had one constraint on the carriers: access to its Android Market. Until now, it’s been extraordinarily lenient with that authority, even allowing them to replace such core Android programs as its browser, calendar and contacts applications with their own. (Manufacturers can opt out of the Android Market, resulting in such oddities as the no-name Android tablets that arrived in stores last fall with older versions of the operating system and no easy way to install add-on software.) It cannot possibly be a surprise if Google now moves to exploit that limited leverage to fix problems with its product. So why the vitriol over this move? In a scathing post linking to a Businessweek story, influential tech blogger John Gruber labeled Google’s change in strategy “the Android bait-and-switch laid bare” and called Android manager Andy Rubin, engineering vice president Vic Gundotra and departing chief executive Eric Schmidt “shameless, lying hypocrites.” Well, then. I understand the annoyance at a company professing a “don’t be evil” motto, in the way that some people gripe about Apple’s bouts of sanctimoniousness. But just like Apple, Google is a publicly-traded, for-profit corporation - not a monastery, a think tank or a nonprofit like Mozilla. (For that matter, many open-source licenses enforce some limits on what you can do with the code in question. It’s rarely a free-for-all.) I don’t need conspiracy theories here. I find it a lot easier to think that Google, not for the first time, didn’t grasp what sort of companies it was dealing with when it waltzed into this market. Remember, these are the people who had no apparent idea that Google TV would get blocked from the Web sites of major TV networks. If it’s now acting like a red-blooded capitalist instead of a software evangelist - fine. Cracking down on carriers who want early access to the Android source code seems not an injustice but the only rational response for Google if it wants to keep Android’s quality. Save your outrage if Google stops releasing Android source code at all - for example, if the current hold in releasing the source for the Honeycomb, tablet-optimized version of Android never ends - or if it follows the practice of AT&T and blocks you from installing Android programs outside of the Android Market. But unless you believe in a cartoon vision of “open” when it comes to mobile-phone software, there’s little cause to protest Google’s move and more than a few reasons to support it. ' \n",

Reuters Google co-founder Sergey Brin at the unveiling of Buzz in 2010 Back in September, Google agreed to pay $8.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging that the Buzz social-networking service violated users' privacy. This week, lawyers in the case agreed to a list of 12 organizations that would divvy up that money. Most prominent on the list are the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, both of which will get $1 million, as well as the University of California at Berkeley, which will get $900,000 divided among two of its technology-law projects. The Long Beach YMCA will get $500,000 to educate young people about privacy, and a small group called Youth Radio will get $50,000 for similar work. But some major privacy groups didn't make the cut, and they and several of the plaintiffs have filed objections asking the court to take another look. Among them: the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which submitted a complaint about Google Buzz to the FTC in February. The complaint alleged that Google was violating users' privacy by automatically exposing their email contacts when it launched its social-networking service. As part of the FTC investigation that stemmed from EPIC's complaint, Google this week agreed to a consent decree that requires it to submit to privacy audits for the next 20 years, among other things. The lawsuit, which was filed in March, made similar allegations of privacy violations. The September settlement called for about $2 million to go to plaintiffs' attorneys and the rest to go to organizations focused on Internet privacy or privacy education. The settlement agreement said Google and the attorneys should \"\"mutually agree\"\" on recipients of the money. In its objection, EPIC says the attorneys in the lawsuit relied on the organization's work but then excluded it from getting any settlement award money. \"\"There has never been, nor is there likely to be\"\" an applicant \"\"who is more deserving of an allocation from a settlement fund,\"\" the organization wrote in its filing. Google declined to comment on the matter. EPIC did not respond to requests for comment on its complaint. One of the attorneys in the class-action suit said they would file a response to the court next week. Those who are objecting also point out that half the groups getting money in the settlement already are partially funded by Google. One of the recipients, the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, \"\"receives so much money from Google that it has actually agreed to refrain from all litigation involving Google,\"\" three plaintiffs write in their objection, pointing to the Stanford center's own online documentation. These issues raise \"\"red flags,\"\" the objectors say, suggesting that Google sought to keep money from certain privacy groups it found problematic and funnel money to other organizations. \"\"EPIC did the hard legal work which led to the investigation,\"\" said Jeffrey Chester, director of the Center for Digital Democracy, another group seeking funds from the court. During negotiations this fall on the settlement, he says, \"\"Google was aware it was in the final stages of having to swallow an elaborate and far-reaching\"\" FTC ruling brought on by EPIC. \"\"Why would you want critics to get funding?\"\" ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: '4 Reasons Why ThunderBolt Could Be Outselling Verizon's iPhone The HTC ThunderBolt is reportedly outselling Apple’s iPhone 4 in some Verizon locations, if one analyst firm is correct. BGR shares the information from BTIG Research, which has called more than 150 Verizon stores to gather sales data. Nearly two-thirds of the stores indicated sales are neck-and-neck between the two devices, while 28 percent reported the ThunderBolt is proving more popular than the iPhone. Without actual sales numbers from either Verizon or Apple, there’s no way to verify the analyst claims, but there are four logical reasons why they might be true: The next iPhone. While many Verizon customers waited more than 3.5 years to see an iPhone for their network of choice, it’s difficult to imagine that all who waited actually bought the Verizon iPhone when it came out. Why? Apple’s annual refresh cycle for the iPhone is nearly common knowledge to the masses and would be well-known to any Verizon customer who’s been waiting for a CDMA iPhone since June of 2007. There’s no guarantee this June will see the next iPhone — there are even rumors of a September release — but after waiting 3.5 years, it makes sense to wait a few more months in case Apple does follow the traditional iPhone refresh cycle with an updated model. 4G is a huge differentiator. The HTC ThunderBolt is the first, and currently, the only, 4G handset able to use Verizon’s speedy LTE mobile broadband network. Verizon’s iPhone is stuck on the older EVDO 3G network, and although many factors influence network speeds, a 3G Verizon iPhone surfs the web around 10 times slower than the HTC ThunderBolt in a 4G coverage area. Verizon is also pushing the LTE capabilities by offering 4G data for the ThunderBolt at the same monthly price as the 3G data plan used by the iPhone. And the operator is throwing in personal hotspot function for free until May 15 on the ThunderBolt. Apple Stores are missing from the equation. Here’s a fly in the ointment for those thinking the BTIG data can be applied to overall handset sales. You can’t assume that the ThunderBolt is selling better than the iPhone overall on Verizon’s network, because the data doesn’t include sales figures or estimates from Apple Stores. Again, without any hard sales data from Apple or Verizon, we don’t know how the newest iPhone is selling, but to assume all Verizon iPhones are sold in Verizon stores would be ludicrous. Bigger is better? This line of thought gets into the debate I had with Darrell Etherington last month. I still subscribe to the idea that consumers are intrigued by larger displays on smartphones which are still highly pocketable. Yes, the 960×640 resolution on the iPhone 4 is stellar, but the 800×480 resolution on the ThunderBolt’s 4.3-inch screen is quite nice and the keyboard is less cramped due to the extra room. Yet, the larger screen doesn’t boost the device size that much over the iPhone 4. Apple’s handset measures 4.5″ x 2.3″ x 0.4″, while the ThunderBolt comes in a 4.8″ x 2.6″ x 0.5″ in size. Either way, the situation is a win-win for Verizon and its customers. Those who want a Verizon iPhone now have the option after years of making do with alternative handsets or carriers. And people who prefer Android and/or want to surf on Verizon’s LTE network can do so with the ThunderBolt. A truer comparison between the iPhone and competing Android handsets on Verizon starts with Apple’s next handset, especially if it has LTE capabilities, as several new Android phones are expected to have in the next few months. Until then — or until we see actual Verizon iPhone sales figures — the ThunderBolt appears to be having a good run against the iPhone, and for good reasons.

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Larry Page set to take over as Google CEO starting Monday When Google (GOOG) co-founder Larry Page reclaims the role of CEO on Monday, it will be business as usual at the Googleplex. No formal ceremonies are planned. There will be no speeches. The absence of pomp underscores Page's focus on the job ahead - spurring Google to innovate faster as it battles Facebook and other competitors, to react more like a nimble start-up even as it zooms past 25,000 employees. As he takes the reins, Page's aim appears to be to hone Google's sense of discipline, to keep the company's management structure as flat as possible despite its growth, and particularly, to urge Googlers to continue to think big. But there are also questions about whether Page's personality, including his detachment and his past unwillingness to be the public face of Google, will well serve a company facing a host of regulatory challenges. \"\"To a large extent, the culture of Google is what Larry wants it to be,\"\" said Craig Silverstein, who joined Page and co-founder Sergey Brin as the startup's first employee in 1998. Google announced in January that Page, Google's CEO from its incorporation in 1998 until Eric Schmidt's arrival in 2001, would again become CEO as of April 4. Since then, Page has made some subtle but interesting changes to how the company operates. He has told Googlers to change how they run meetings to make them more focused and productive, and he has directed executives to meet in public areas of the Googleplex so they will be more accessible to hearing ideas from rank-and-file Googlers, say people familiar with the changes. Schmidt and co-founder Sergey Brin have been more in the public spotlight than the 38-year-old son of a computer science professor from Michigan over the past decade. But Page has remained a driving force within Google since 2001, insisting on reviewing every hire, say people familiar with the company, and continuing to push hyper-ambitious projects like the company's effort to scan every book ever published into a vast digital library. \"\"It's certainly true that Eric is the public face, but inside Google, the founders are still very much the face of the company in many ways,\"\" said Silverstein, who spoke in an interview just after the Jan. 20 announcement that Page would return to the CEO job, with Schmidt becoming executive chairman. Page has a foresight that few people have, Silverstein said. Page a was a driving force for the massive computing power Google needed to create, long before many at Google saw the need for products like Google Instant - the feature the search giant introduced last year, and that Yahoo (YHOO) recently imitated, that begins to offers search results as soon as users type a letter into the query box. \"\"He'll have an idea that seems really crazy, that we should have enough computing power that we can do something like Google Instant, long before we did it, and everbody says, \"\"We'll have to spend billions on that!\"\" and there will be all this push-back, and he'll hve none of it,\"\" Silverstein said. Paul Buchheit, the former Googler who coined the phrase, \"\"Don't Be Evil,\"\" said Page's return sends a signal to Silicon Valley that innovation and taking risks for big ideas still matter at Google. \"\"This notion that something being impossible doesn't really bother you, that's really central to a lot of Google's big projects,\"\" said Buchheit, who created Gmail before leaving the company in 2006. When you look at them from the start, they seem impossible - and that does not deter\"\" Page, Buchheit said. \"\"It's taking on things that might be possible or might be impossible, but if they are possible, it would have a really big impact on the world.\"\" No one expects Page to be a standard-issue CEO. Those like Silverstein who know Page well say that while he isn't shy, neither is he an extroverted, hale-fellow-well met. But he has also been described as brusque with people whose ideas he doesn't value, and he has often shunned press attention. Some Google watchers say Page's famous reticience and his skepticism of the value of external communication may not serve him well as CEO. \"\"Brilliant engineers like Page are really good at things they can measure. They have high a high IQ, but often a low EQ,\"\" or emotional quotient, said Ken Auletta, who spent two years inside the Googleplex reporting his book, \"\"Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.\"\" \"\"Larry is not as talented at things he can't measure, like why governments and citizens might fear Google's dominance, or issues like privacy and copyright. Page certainly is more aware of government and other outside concerns. But they make him impatient. Which is dangerous when you're wrestling with an 800-pound government gorilla.\"\" Page faces a full and complex plate of legal and regulatory issues when he takes on his new job. Just this week the Federal Trade Commission forced Google into a 20-year commitment to accept outside supervision on privacy, and archrival Microsoft filed an antitrust complaint against Google in Europe. A decision by the U.S. Department of Justice on whether to block on antitrust grounds Google's $700 million purchase of ITA Software, which makes the most heavily used airfare search software, is expected soon. On the day Google announced the change at the top, Page said: \"\"I've learned a ton from (Schmidt) over the years.\"\" He may need those new skills to deal with politicans and regulators in Washington and Brussels who are pushing for an increasing voice in Google's future. Veteran tech analyst Rob Enderle, who praised the reshuffling in January, said he has become concerned since then that Page \"\"will not step up to the full requirements of the job, which include being the human face of Google.\"\" Google declined to make Page available for an interview. Yardsticks like profit and revenue suggest Google has never been more successful, and its Android smartphone software gives the company a powerful foothold in the emerging mobile web. But Google stock is down 6 percent since the Jan. 20 announcement that Page would replace Schmidt as CEO, a period in which the NASDAQ is up 3 percent. It's unclear how Googlers as a group view the change at the top, but they don't seem to be cheering Schmidt's departure. The employment website Glassdoor.com released a study Friday saying Schmidt has a 96 percent approval rating from Googlers filing anonymous ratings of their CEO over the past 12 months, an even higher rating than Apple's (AAPL) Steve Jobs. Buchheit always believed Page's return as CEO was inevitable, and that Page's determination to swing for the fences is critical to Google's identity. \"\"It was just a question of when it was going to happen,\"\" Buchheit said of Page's return. \"\"He was originally the CEO and the only reason that changed was because the VCs required it to change. He has a lot of pretty strong opinions about how this thing should be run, and he's stayed very involved in the company.\"\" ' \n",

I am saddened by the course of events that led to my departure and the incorrect reporting of it. I am now focused on moving on past this unfortunate series of events.\"\" Facebook can monitor whether its employees are purchasing shares - every time its shares are sold in the secondary market as a private placement Facebook has right of first refusal. A source at a platform that trades these shares tells me Facebook is meticulous, and certainly would take note of an employee name on a transaction. So if Brown had gone to SecondMarket, his request to trade likely would have been rejected. That means Brown likely bought his shares through a private company fund, of which there are several, run by SharesPost, Felix, and Wedbush. This shines the spotlight on funds of private company shares as an area where the SEC is likely to really crack down. These funds make private shares far more like securities, and when it comes to insider trading they're far harder for companies to monitor than individual transactions.

Apple has filed for a patent that would involve taking multiple pictures and meshing them together to create a 3-dimensional image — a process that would include the use of two cameras instead of one — according to AppleInsider. It remains to be seen as to whether Apple will jump on the 3D bandwagon, but many companies have already embraced the technology. There are actually a number of phones on the market that already use 3D cameras and displays. The EVO 3D, which debuted at CTIA Wireless 2011, uses a pair of cameras on the back of the phone to capture high-definition 3D video. The patent indicates that the technology would allow the iPhone to shoot still images in 3D and also record high-definition 3D video, according to the report. Both the EVO 3D and Nintendo’s latest handheld gaming device, the 3DS, uses a technology called a parallax barrier — which basically only lets each eye see a certain set of pixels ont he screen. That means that each eye sees something different, and the brain combines the images. The net effect is an illusion of depth and a 3D image without needing cumbersome 3D glasses. The patent doesn’t indicate whether Apple’s next iteration of the iPhone would carry a similar screen using parallax barrier technology. But 3D has not emerged as the dominant new trend in display technology, as there are some complaints about whether it places undue strain on eyes. The Nintendo 3DS, for example, warns users to take a break from time to time so they do not strain their eyes. Apple is expected to delay the release of its next iPhone until the fall. That would give the company more than enough time to introduce a number of new pieces of technology to the device, including access to the next generation of wireless networks.

The merger between CenturyLink and Qwest officially closed today, creating the nation’s third-largest phone company in a world where being a phone company means less and less. To honor the occasion, CenturyLink (we lose the Qwest name) offered to have Christopher Ancell, president of business markets, talk with me about what the future holds in his division, which includes corporate telecommunications customers and those buying data center services. The two big themes are that bandwidth demand is continuing to grow and that the new scale gained through this acquisition might help CenturyLink make some cloud-related deals. In the last year, Qwest had tiptoed into the on-demand services market by providing application recovery and interactive voice recognition on demand, but it wasn’t as large a player as Verizon with its Compute-as-a-Service products. And in January, Verizon said it would purchase Terremark, a provider of private clouds and data centers in a deal valued at $1.4 billion, saying cloud services were a big growth area for the company. Ancell agrees, although when I asked about the likelihood of a CenturyLink acquisition in this space, he replied, “Glen [Post] is an acquirer and has been the CEO for 19 years and has a track record of acquiring companies, and I would expect that to continue.” Ancell says the merger gives CenturyLink scale and larger free cash flow, which could boost its deal-making capabilities. The company is trying to figure out what customers want from Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers and what they want as software. Qwest had 17 data centers that it brings to CenturyLink, which as of the end of 2010, reported $172.94 million in cash and $2 billion in operating free cash flow. It does have more than $7 billion in debt, however, and none of that includes Qwest’s contribution. Aside from a possible rush to the cloud, CenturyLink closes this deal with 190,000 miles of fiber, after adding 75,000 miles of Qwest local fiber and 30,000 miles of Qwest backbone fiber. As it seeks to serve businesses and data centers, the biggest constant is bandwidth demand continuing to grow. Ancell echoed what I had heard recently about larger corporations wanting to upgrade to 100 Gigabit access from 10 Gigabit pipes — completely skipping over the 40 Gigabit access. He cautioned that not everyone was skipping 40 Gigabit access, but that the awesome demand for video and other applications was causing companies to look hard at their upgrades. With 40 percent of network traffic being video, the demand is continuing to rise, he said. “People just need more and more bandwidth at rates that almost have us saying, ‘What is going on?’”Ancell said.

In terms of UI aesthetics, the touch site was superior in that it features some nice AJAX support, which made loading things very quick. It was, however, lacking in some functionality; for instance, you couldn't view or manage your pokes. The main feed was also plagued by the issue of it displaying posts and status updates from eight hours ago, rather than showing the latest (at least, that was an issue I experienced). The new site looks like a sort of combination between the previous two incarnations of Facebook Mobile, and also is much more of a Web app rather than a bog standard mobile version of Facebook. Every feature is there, including the ability to check in to venues using Facebook Places. There are certainly a lot of design hints taken from Facebook's hugely successful iPhone app, in particular the nice little \"\"Like\"\" or \"\"Comment\"\" popup when you press the \"\"+\"\" button next to a friend's post. The layout of everything, including the three tabs at the top enabling you to access your profile, messages, and \"\"more\"\" options, is reminiscent of the new Facebook layout you see on your desktop. All in all, it's a pretty cool redesign that irons out all of the issues that the two previous versions of Facebook's mobile site had, and unifies their better features.

Others have tried and not quite made it. But RockMelt believes it can get the (mostly younger) demographic who lives and breathes social media to attach itself to RockMelt. About 70% of RockMelt users are between 18 and 34, and 41% of its users are in high school or college. Unlike other Internet product loyalties like search engines or email, it's theoretically easier to switch web browsers, as Google Chrome has shown. But then again, that's Google. If RockMelt can break through, it’s a big opportunity. When it launched last fall, the company drew strong interest, partly due to its funding from Andreessen Horowitz, including Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen. RockMelt integrates social networking services like Facebook and Twitter directly into the browser to make a more interactive and social experience. Facebook friends show up on the edge of the browser for quick chats, while updates from Twitter and Facebook are easily reachable on the other side of the browser. The thinking is that these social services are used the most, so it makes sense to put them at your finger tips. Since people are using the web to communicate with friends and consume information, RockMelt is attempting to bake all these services directly into the browser. RockMelt has just released a new version of the browser, RockMelt Beta 2, with several changes in response to requests from users. First it's allowing multiple Facebook chats simultaneously by placing its chat bar on the bottom of the browser. It also added a new Twitter app that gives fuller Twitter functionality, such as replies and search. Interestingly, RockMelt has also added Instapaper support, which enables people to read articles later on their mobile devices or PCs by clicking a button. This read-it-later service has become a replacement of the traditional browser bookmark for the short-attention-span, digital generation. Still, will people switch from established players in the space like Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome or Microsoft's Internet Explorer? These incumbents are increasingly becoming similar, which makes it easier for RockMelt to stand out, says with Eric Vishria, CEO and founder of RockMelt. \"\"Most people have no idea what a browser is,\"\" Vishria says. \"\"If you look at the differences between the browsers on the market today they're very small... With RockMelt you can see it visually so it’s very different and you can quickly understand what it is.\"\" Vishria said RockMelt has \"\" a few hundred thousand\"\" users. ' \n",

Yet there is a fair amount of concern that Page's other known traits  his aloofness, rebellious streak and affinity for pursuing wacky ideas  might lead the company astray. Page takes over as CEO on Monday as fast-rising rivals and tougher regulators threaten Google's growth. Investors used to Google Inc.\"\"s consistency in exceeding financial targets worry that new leadership will bring more emphasis on long-term projects that take years to pay off. And many people still aren't sure he has enough management skills to steer the Internet's most powerful company. Page already has learned that smarts alone won't make him a great leader. Although Page impressed Google's early investors with his ingenuity, they still insisted that he step down in 2001 as Google's first CEO. He turned over the job to Eric Schmidt, a veteran executive who began working in Silicon Valley in the early 1980s while Page was still in grammar school. Gmail Motion: Google's revolutionary new technology Page's admirers say that at 38, he is more mature and less apt to be chronically late to meetings or tune out of conversations that don't stimulate his intellect  habits that he fell into during his first stint as CEO. \"\"There are parts of being CEO that don't fit Larry's personality,\"\" said Craig Silverstein, the first employee that Page and Google's other founder, Sergey Brin, hired when they started the company in 1998. \"\"You wear a lot of different hats when you're CEO. Some of them are very interesting to Larry and some of them, presumably, are less interesting.\"\" True to his taciturn form, Page hasn't said much publicly since Google made its stunning announcement in January that he will replace Schmidt as CEO. Google said Page wasn't available for an interview. Page, though, has left little doubt about his top priority: to dissolve the bureaucracy and complacency that accompanied the company's rapid transformation into a 21st-century empire. Google is expected to end the year with more than 30,000 employees and $35 billion in annual revenue. In Page's mind, the 13-year-old company needs to return to thinking and acting like a feisty startup. Rising Internet stars such as Facebook, Twitter and Groupon, all less than 8 years old, are developing products that could challenge Google and make its dominance of Internet search less lucrative. Page has drawn comparisons to two high-tech geniuses who are even more accomplished: Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs. Like those two pioneers in personal technology, Page invented and cultivated a product that changed the world. But Page has yet to match them in this respect: as CEOs, Gates and Jobs brought out the best in the companies that they created, delighting stockholders as their investments soared. Page doesn't fit the CEO mold, even by the standards of Silicon Valley's free-wheeling culture. He dropped out of graduate school at Stanford to start Google and doesn't have a business degree. Science and technology, though, seems to be in his DNA even though he grew up in Michigan, where automobiles rule. His late father, Carl, was a computer scientist and pioneer in artificial intelligence, and his mother taught computer programming. Page began working on personal computers when he was just 6 years old in 1979, when home computers were a rarity. The geeky impulses carried into his adulthood, leading him to once build an inkjet printer out of Legos. Page relishes challenging the status quo and encourages his employees to do so, too. Those who know Page suspect he picked up the anti-establishment mindset as a boy who attended Montessori schools, which discourage structured curricula and encourage independent activities. Page has wanted to control his own destiny  and legacy  since reading a biography of the inventor Nikola Tesla before he was even in high school. Tesla wasn't rewarded or widely recognized for his breakthroughs in X-ray, wireless communications and electricity. Page didn't want that to happen to him as an entrepreneur. For that reason, Page embraced the chance to be Google's CEO when the company started in a rented garage not far from the company's current headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. It also helps explain why he and Brin created a separate class of stock with greater voting power so they and Schmidt could remain in charge after the company went public in 2004. Page's stake in Google has made him one of the world's wealthiest people with an estimated fortune of $20 billion. Although the contours of his personality and background are known quantities, Page remains an enigmatic figure on Wall Street. To some, he remains best known for uncompromising idealism, reflected in his embrace of his company's \"\"Don't Be Evil\"\" motto and his pledge to never cater to investors\"\" desire for ever-rising quarterly earnings at the expense of long-term investments. Page already raised concerns by pushing Google into renewable energy and robotic cars. Those who know him say he has discussed even more far-flung projects behind closed doors. \"\"Sometimes his ideas are just way out there and you're kind of like, \"\"Wow, that came out of left field,\"\"\"\" said Ethan Anderson, a former Google product manager who now runs Redbeacon, a startup that operates a search engine for finding neighborhood businesses. Uncertainty about whether Page will be as interested as Schmidt in appeasing Wall Street has contributed to a 6 percent drop in Google's stock price since the CEO change was announced Jan. 20. The technology-driven Nasdaq index has added 3 percent during that time. BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis doesn't believe it's a coincidence that Google revealed it would hire more than 6,200 employees this year  a 25 percent boost, and the most in its history  less than a week after it announced Page's comeback as CEO. \"\"Don't be surprised if Google's spending goes up, even it means its earnings per share might go down,\"\" Gillis said. Page's supporters believe Google's current market value of about $190 billion will climb even higher under his leadership. That would mirror what happened after Jobs finally got his chance to run Apple in 1997 after a decade in exile. Since then, Apple has brought out the iconic iPod, iPhone and iPad devices and created more than $300 billion in shareholder wealth. But the returns of company founders haven't always been triumphant. Consider Yahoo Inc. co-founder Jerry Yang's second stint as CEO from June 2007 to January 2009. Yahoo's stock fell 56 percent during that period, larger than the 41 percent drop for Nasdaq. Unlike the rest of the Nasdaq, Yahoo shares aren't close to rebounding to their June 2007 levels. Hoping to smooth the transition to a new CEO, Google is keeping Schmidt, 55, in a prominent role as executive chairman and chief liaison with lawmakers and regulators around the world. That's an important job as Google faces growing scrutiny over its ambitions to use its dominance in search to enter new markets. Brin, 37, intends to focus on long-term projects, leaving Page to manage Google's daily operations. \"\"I am quite convinced that this change will result in faster decision-making, better success for the business and ultimately greater value for the shareholders,\"\" Schmidt told The Associated Press after Google announced its shake-up in January. In the past, the three made key decisions by committee, though Schmidt was the one responsible as CEO. Schmidt guided Google through an uninterrupted stretch of prosperity that has topped the performances of other technology trailblazers, including Apple and Microsoft, at similar stages of their corporate lives. Page is better prepared to be CEO after a decade as Schmidt's apprentice, said Douglas Merrill, who worked with both executives before leaving Google in 2008 as vice president of engineering. \"\"Larry has grown over time,\"\" Merrill said. \"\"He has learned how to make projects work. He has learned how to make sure things happen on time and in a predictable fashion. Larry is a sort of a learning machine.\"\" ' \n",

The teacher, who has not been publicly identified, was suspended with pay from her position at School 21 after parents complained to the school and asked that their children be removed from her class, district officials told The Record of North Jersey. Terry Corallo, a spokeswoman for the Paterson district, e-mailed a statement on Friday confirming that the teacher was on paid administrative leave, adding that “this matter is a personnel issue that is under investigation.” On Friday, the teacher declined through her lawyer, Nancy Oxfeld, to comment. Ms. Oxfeld said any comments that the teacher had made on Facebook were done on her own time and to her friends. “My feeling is that if you’re concerned about children, you’re concerned about what goes on in the classroom, not about policing your employee’s private comments to others,” Ms. Oxfeld said. Ms. Oxfeld, who was contacted through the New Jersey Education Association, declined to give her client’s name. Word of the Facebook comment spread across Paterson and beyond, and spurred e-mail exchanges, water-cooler gossip and more postings on Facebook. Irene Sterling, president of the Paterson Education Fund, a nonprofit group that supports the local school community, said parents were angry about the teacher’s comments because anyone, including her own students, could have read the negative characterizations. She said it highlighted a lack of commitment by some teachers. “It’s horrible,” she said. “And unfortunately, I don’t think she’s the only teacher in Paterson who thinks that way.” The Paterson district, with 28,000 students and 2,425 teachers, has long been one of New Jersey’s most troubled school systems; it was taken over by the state in 1991 because of fiscal mismanagement and poor academic performance. In a similar episode, a high school English teacher in Doylestown, Pa., was suspended recently after she called students “disengaged, lazy whiners” on her blog. Jonathan Zimmerman, a New York University history professor who has written about education, said teachers, like other professionals, had responsibilities. He compared the episodes to a doctor talking loudly about cases on a crowded train. “It seems to me with professional responsibility comes a duty to exercise discretion,” he said. ' \n",

Don't panic. This particular bit of hacker mischief is setting off alarms among online security watchdogs for its speed and scope, but built-in software safeguards mean few actual users will end up suffering. The exploit drew headlines because it's affecting a surprisingly large number of websites - nearly 4 million so far - and because some of those sites feed into Apple's iTunes platform. Websense, the security software vendor that first broke the news about LizaMoon in its blog, played up the iTunes connection in its first warning about the attack. But Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) has iTunes designed to automatically neutralize this kind of threat. That means there's zero risk of an iTunes user's computer actually getting infected by this bit of malware. Websense acknowledged that in its latest LizaMoon update. \"\"Every time there's a mass-injection like this, and there really hasn't been anything this big before, we try to identify larger systems and sites that have been affected,\"\" the company wrote in its blog. \"\"There are few systems out there bigger than iTunes, so when we saw that content on itunes.apple.com contained the injected link we wanted to make people aware of that, even if the script didn't work.\"\" LizaMoon is what's called a SQL code injection attack, where a Web application vulnerability is exploited to inject malicious code into affected websites. If a Web surfer visits an affected site, they'll be redirected to a rogue website that tries to install a \"\"scareware\"\" file. The file generates messages warning the user that their computer is infected with viruses, and offers to sell them antivirus software in defense. Most actual, legitimate antivirus programs will detect and eliminate the malicious file. And most websites have protections in place to prevent them from getting infected in the first place. While LizaMoon has infested million of websites, security experts say it's a run-of-the-mill threat that is mostly hitting obscure, low-traffic sites. \"\"Defense against your sites getting infected is the standard things we ought to be doing anyway,\"\" the SANS Internet Storm Center, a security monitoring site, wrote in its LizaMoon analysis.

While some music fans are applauding the idea of storing their tunes in the cloud, the Amazon Cloud Drive is facing criticism because of the time it takes to upload files and fueling experts’ doubts. Carl Howe, director of the Yankee Group’s Anywhere Consumer Research Group, said the market for the service has yet to be proven. “I really don’t hear people complaining that they don’t have cloud access to their music,” he said. The service gives users 5 gigabytes of free space to store files — music, photos or documents, for example — in the cloud, accessible from any computer with an Internet connection. Extra storage can be purchased for $1 per GB, at intervals ranging from 20GB to 1,000GB. Songs bought through Amazon’s MP3 store can be automatically uploaded to the cloud service, and streamed via Web browser or a mobile app made for Google’s Android mobile operating system. The app will not be available for Apple iOS devices such as the iPhone or iPad. Apple, which has been the dominant player in digital music for years, imposes restrictions on music-playing apps sold in the iTunes App Store. Amazon’s streaming service has already run afoul of the record labels, which want licensing fees for the streamed music and the company has quickly agreed to work out deals with the labels. Apple bought music- streaming company LaLa in 2009, but shut the service down last year. At the time, rumors swirled that Apple was readying a cloud-based iTunes, but Howe said iTunes’ success has been based on Apple’s philosophy that people like to own their music and carry it around with them. Google is reportedly testing a new music service. Howe said the Cloud Drive is trying to do too many things — including acting as a digital storage locker and streaming music service — which may confuse consumers. “It’s got to decide what it wants to be when it grows up,” he said. Still, Howe added that the market may develop after a few years, and called the service a low-risk move on Amazon’s part, since the technology is built on the company’s existing cloud infrastructure. “They already had this stuff,” he said. bizsmart@bostonherald.com ' \n",

According to a series of 1,000 speed tests conducted by BTIG Research in New York City over the past few weeks, Sprint’s 4G network gets download speeds of around 1 megabit per second on average — far slower than even 3G networks on rival carriers. In comparison, Verizon’s 4G network — which runs on competing LTE technology — achieved download speeds nearly 10 times as fast on average. The test reveals Sprint’s deep dark secret about its 4G network: it’s simply not that fast. That’s mainly due to the company putting its weight behind WiMax technology years before it could see the potential of LTE. Now with faster LTE networks being deployed by Verizon and AT&T, Sprint’s going to have a hard time convincing consumers that they should pay extra for its slower 4G speeds. BTIG tested the networks by using the wireless hotspot functionality on Sprint’s flagship Evo 4G phone and Verizon’s recently launched HTC Thunderbolt. The research firm tracked the speeds of both an iPad 2 and a Toshiba laptop connected to the hotspots. Indoors, Verizon’s network averaged download speeds of 8.3 Mbps and upload speeds of 4.47 Mbps. Sprint’s, on the other hand, clocked in at 1.19 Mbps down and .39 Mbps up. You can see the full speed results at the chart below. BTIG also pointed out that Verizon’s network was more reliable, and the Thunderbolt achieved better battery life than the Evo. It should be noted that BTIG’s Sprint 4G speeds seem slower than other speed tests, where Sprint normally achieves download speeds of around 2 Mbps to 3 Mbps. But even that seems difficult to call 4G — both AT&T and T-Mobile’s 3G networks can hit those speeds without issue. And when you compare Sprint’s 4G speeds to Verizon’s ridiculously fast LTE, it definitely seems like Sprint 4G customers are getting shortchanged.

The so-called \"\"mass-injection\"\" attack, which experts say is the largest of its kind ever seen, has managed to insert malicious code into websites by gaining access to the servers running the databases behind the Internet, according to the technology security company that discovered it. Websense, which first found evidence of the attack earlier this week, has called it \"\"LizaMoon,\"\" after the site to which the malicious code first directed its researchers. Users can see that they are being redirected when they attempt to visit an infected address, and can close the window with no ill effects, said Patrik Runald , a senior manager of security research at Websense. The attack has largely affected small websites so far, he said, with no evidence that popular corporate or government websites have been compromised. If users do not close the window after typing an infected address, or clicking an infected link, they are redirected to a page showing a warning from \"\"Windows Stability Center\"\" - posing as a Microsoft Corp security product - that there are problems with their computer and they are urged to pay for software to fix it. Websense said the site appeared to be set up by sophisticated fraudsters out to make money, but it was not clear whether the site also planted malicious software on users' computers if they made a purchase on the site, or if the operation was linked to an identity theft scam. The presentation of the bogus website, as shown by Websense, is high quality but clearly fraudulent. Microsoft has no product called \"\"Windows Stability Center\"\". The company did not immediately have a comment on the attack. Websense said some third-party Web addresses containing information about podcasts available on Apple Inc's iTunes service had been compromised, but said Apple appeared to have prevented the malicious links from working. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The attack may take some time to be tamed, warned Runald, as researchers first have to identify the software being compromised, and then website operators have to install updated software. \"\"Attacks like this tend to stay for a very long time,\"\" he said. \"\"Once they are onto something, it tends to stay with us.

Yet there is a fair amount of concern that Page's other known traits — his aloofness, rebellious streak and affinity for pursuing wacky ideas — might lead the company astray. The East Lansing native takes over as CEO on Monday as fast-rising rivals and tougher regulators threaten Google's growth. Investors used to Google Inc.\"\"s consistency in exceeding financial targets worry that new leadership will bring more emphasis on long-term projects that take years to pay off. And many still aren't sure he has enough management skills to steer the Internet's most powerful company. Page, a University of Michigan grad, already has learned that smarts alone won't make him a great leader. Although Page impressed Google's early investors with his ingenuity, they still insisted that he step down in 2001 as Google's first CEO. He turned over the job to Eric Schmidt, a veteran executive who began working in Silicon Valley in the early 1980s while Page was still in grammar school. Page's admirers say that at 38, he is more mature and less apt to be chronically late to meetings or tune out of conversations that don't stimulate his intellect — habits that he fell into during his first stint as CEO. \"\"There are parts of being CEO that don't fit Larry's personality,\"\" said Craig Silverstein, the first employee who Page and Google's other founder, Sergey Brin, hired when they started the company in 1998. \"\"You wear a lot of different hats when you're CEO.

It coincides with the transmission of an interview he recorded on Monday with David Letterman, in which he admits he had \"\"low energy\"\" during his lamented helmsmanship of the ABC telecast for the awards. Some fans of Renaissance man Franco, 32 , have also noted that he deleted his account on April Fool's Day and are hoping that the sudden disappearance is a Franconian prank. However seasoned followers say it lacks his trademark surreal humour. The 127 Hours star himself seemed to lay the matter to rest when he predicted the death of social media at a dinner in Washington, just hours before he pulled the account. Speaking at the creative writing non-profit 826DC's benefit held at the Monaco Hotel, actor, writer, artist and Ph.D student Franco said: \"\"Social media is over. Still up there. Going down. You heard it here first.\"\" Franco, who was speaking to newsite Politico, added: \"\"My thought was \"\"this is my Twitter. I can do whatever I want. But certain companies I work with contacted me about what I was saying.\"\" His tweets throughout that ill-fated hosting gig alongside Anne Hathaway, 28 , created a huge buzz on the social media site. Equally, much hype has surrounded the handsome actor posting pictures of himself sleeping with his pet cats and visceral home-made comics showcasing his acerbic wit. But a feud with seasoned Oscar writer Bruce Villanch after that disastrous night, struck a sour note amongst all the creativity. Villanch told New York magazine that Franco had too many \"\"balls in the air\"\" to focus on the job, adding: \"\"He didn't get there.\"\" \"\"I don't think he realized how big a deal it is to do it until he was actually confronted with it.\"\" Franco, who will hit cinemas in Your Highness alongside Danny McBride and Natalie Portman next Friday, hit back by posting a picture of himself and Villanch on his Twitter account. Over the picture, which he eventually deleted, he daubed the sarcastic caption: \"\"James f***ed up the Oscars. Trust me, I know comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler!\"\" But last night a more serious Franco contemplated the danger to creativity that sites like Twitter and Facebook pose. Wearing a sharp grey suit with one hand running through his trademark tousled hair, he addressed the benefit. \"\"If you want to write, make the time,\"\" he encouraged. Before adding: \"\"We all have an hour or two a day that can be used for surfing Facebook or writing. No one is going to beg any new writer to write.\"\" Franco, who is pursuing a doctorate at Yale, concluded: \"\"I feel like I didn't get a ton of support in school in creative subjects and I went to a great public school.

By Google. Again. True to its notorious April Fools’ Day tradition of jokes and hoaxes, Google “officially announced” the availability of Gmail Motion for all to see, and for some to believe. Gmail Motion is allegedly “a new way to communicate” via the super futuristic and efficient human computer interaction. In other words, you gullible people, can control your Gmail with your body. If you were able to download this amazing-beyond-your-imagination application. And here is how it works, allegedly. Gmail Motion uses your computer’s built-in webcam and Google’s patented spatial tracking technology to detect your movements and translate them into meaningful characters and commands. Movements are designed to be simple and intuitive for people of all skill levels. You can familiarize yourself with some of the basic functionality of Gmail Motion using a printable guide of sample gestures. With it, you’ll be able to start writing and responding to emails – with your body — in no time. (see illustraions) Google even came out with some safety precautions — which should give you a strong hint that something’s just not right in the equation, or application. “Using Gmail Motion is not only safe but also healthy and fun. As with any physical activity, certain precautions are recommended. First, make sure to clear the area around you. Second, try to take short breaks every 30-40 minutes, just as you would if you were typing. And finally, take time to stretch after each session to give the muscles you’ll be using some relief.” “This new motion detection technology doesn’t stop with Gmail. We’re excited to announce that Google Docs Motion will be coming later this year. Learn more.” Learn more? No, it’s better to learn your lesson. Google has a tradition of creating April Fools’ Day jokes. Some of the most memorable, especially to those who were easilly duped into believing, were the Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web. Four April Fools’ Days ago, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet. On the same day and year, Google’s Gmail page displayed an announcement for Gmail Paper, allowing users to have email messages printed and shipped to them. In 2010, Google jokingly changed its company name to Topeka in honor of Topeka, Kansas, whose mayor actually changed the city’s name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google’s decision in its new Google Fiber Project. And 2011 is no different. After Gmail Motion, other Google pranks available for downloading — if you can — are: Comic Sans — searching ‘Helvetic’ on the Google changes the font on the search page to everyone’s favorite font: Comic Sans; Chromercise; Google Earth — search for various wild and mythical animals on its maps on Google Earth; Google Blimp Ads — display your ads thru Google blimps; Google Teleport — is a website written in Simplified Chinese that allows the user to travel through space and time; and Job Openings For Autocompleters, whatever that is.

      "Warning! Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Why Google is getting into the \"\"Like\"\" business Computerworld - Google announced this week a new social search feature called +1. The new offering competes in some ways with Facebook's \"\"Like\"\" button. By clicking on an optional new +1 button on your Google search results, you can tell family and friends that you recommend certain links. Big deal, right? Well, actually, it could soon be a very big deal. What Google's +1 adds up to Google's +1 isn't what Google would call a \"\"shipping\"\" product. It's a \"\"Labs\"\" experiment, a cross between a beta program and a trial balloon. But it's available to everyone and easy to use. You just go to the Google Labs page and click \"\"Join this experiment\"\" in the section about +1. Once you've done that, when you're searching on Google, you'll see a +1 button on every search. All your +1 recommendations are retained on a new tab viewable on your Google Profile. You can choose to make them public or keep them private. (I've made mine public - you can check my +1\"\"s here.) Also: When your Google contacts conduct searches of their own that bring back links you've flagged with +1, they'll see your recommendation on the results page. For now, the feature is limited to Google Search. Google plans to roll out the feature for websites of all kinds, including blogs. Google also says it plans to \"\"record information about your +1 activity in order to provide you and other users with a better experience on Google services.\"\" That could mean just about anything, although Google says +1 activity does not affect search rankings. How +1 is like, and unlike, \"\"Like\"\" Once Google offers the ability for website owners to add +1 buttons on their sites, the service will be a lot like Facebook's \"\"Like\"\" feature. With Facebook, everything you \"\"Like\"\" anywhere on the Web is viewable by friends on Facebook. And that's one of the differences. With +1, your recommendations are currently unlikely to be encountered \"\"in the wild\"\" by contacts. It requires both opt-in by contacts, plus the unlikely event that the other person searches for something you've already flagged. Google +1 is currently useful only for seeing someone's preferences after you've run across them on your own, while Facebook \"\"Like\"\" is better for discovery. Both could be a lot better for discovery. What's missing from both Google's and Facebook's recommendation engines is the ability to pool all that data in a single space. The ultimate application would be open APIs by both parties, with some scrappy startup building the ultimate Digg replacement site where both systems are combined into a single popularity contest for content. One advantage of +1 over Like is that it lets you recommend things without appearing to approve of them. When I encounter a blog post headlined \"\"Tickets for Apple's Developer Event Selling for $3,500 on eBay\"\" and click the Facebook \"\"Like\"\" button, it appears on my Wall above the phrase \"\"Mike Elgan Likes this.\"\" It makes me look like a sociopath. Google's +1 is more neutral. Google currently has two incompatible systems. You can click +1 on search. But on Buzz, where the +1 could really find some use, Google uses the word \"\"Like\"\" in a system that's disconnected from the +1 recommendations. This is especially awkward because Google went to great pains to connect Profiles and Buzz. But +1 recommendations show up in Profiles, and \"\"Likes\"\" remain in Buzz. It's a fractured mess. Meanwhile, Facebook's \"\"Like\"\" system is unified. Why +1 and Like matter Social recommendation tools like +1 and Like can potentially help users do things such as the following:  Get and give recommendations to friends (replacing link sharing).  Bring attention to cool stuff (replacing or enhancing Digg and Reddit).  Bookmark and remember things (replacing browser bookmarks, Instapaper and StumbleUpon).  Set up popularity polls (replacing poll plug-ins on blogs).  Engage in social science research (replacing text-based voting on American Idol ). The exciting thing about the Like-button concept is that it can, and probably will, spill over into the real world. Within a few years, you'll probably be able to \"\"Like\"\" TV shows, locations (via existing location-based services like Foursquare, Google Latitude or Facebook Places. Smartphone app-based services are getting better and better at recognizing songs and TV shows (by the sound), and soon they'll be able to recognize objects that you photograph with the camera in your phone. So you'll be able to \"\"Like\"\" all kinds of content and objects in the real world. Google's +1 system is new and experimental and therefore isn't changing the world yet. Facebook's \"\"Like\"\" system is becoming influential, but it's still overshadowed by Twitter, link sharing and other ways of sharing and recommending content. The reason this is a big deal is this: History tells us that obscure, trivial services like Twitter and Facebook and even Google itself can rise to dominate user attention, and make billions for the entrepreneurs who get it right. Whoever dominates \"\"Like\"\"-type services could end up making enormous amounts of money. The whole \"\"Like\"\" idea is potentially superior to link sharing, bookmarking, social bookmarking, polling and other technologies that millions of people use every day. If the concept really takes hold, it could become the primary way for people to share content, links, opinions and much more. And don't even get me started on the marketing potential. Once companies get us to start \"\"Liking\"\" and recommending the products and services we buy, they'll have found a lucrative enhancement to advertising and marketing campaigns. Google +1, Facebook \"\"Like\"\" or some other service we don't know about yet could one day rise to dominate the lucrative new world of social influence.

It takes serious guts for Amazon to simply declare that it doesn’t need licenses — especially when even casual observers know the music industry thinks otherwise. Still, this isn’t a one-dimensional issue, and the law has yet to deal much with services like Amazon’s. Record companies fantasize about huge revenues from streaming services, and they fear digital lockers like the plague. ‘The word streaming and the word download are nowhere in copyright law’ — MP3tunes’ CEO Michael Robertson If the record labels don’t come to a licensing agreement with Amazon soon, they will either be forced to take legal action or implicitly allow other music companies to ditch cloud licenses too. Amazon vs. the music industry Amazon launched two new services, Cloud Drive and Cloud Player, earlier this week. U.S. Amazon customers can get free online storage from Amazon to use for whatever they please, but users are heavily encouraged to upload their local music libraries. All Amazon MP3 purchases are automatically synced to the user’s Cloud Drive without counting against the quota, too. Once the music is copied to the remote drive, users can then use the Cloud Player Android or Web app to stream the music to any compatible device or browser, even if the files themselves had not been synced there. Both Apple and Google are expected to launch very similar services in the future, but neither has made an announcement. Google’s music service is rumored to offer both music downloads and streams to go with its own digital locker — the service would scan a user’s computer and automatically add any tracks that Google has licensed to that user’s online locker. Apple’s may involve unlimited music redownloads and streams to iOS devices as part of a MobileMe revamp, and Apple is currently believed to be in talks with the Big Four music labels — Sony Music, Universal Music Group (UMG), Warner Music Group (WMG) and EMI — to make it happen. If Apple and Google are dutifully trying to hammer out licensing deals, why did Amazon go ahead and launch Cloud Player without them? Amazon argues that Cloud Drive and Cloud Player are just services that let users upload and play back their own music, just like “any number of existing media management applications.” After all, licenses shouldn’t be necessary for users to play their own music, right? The labels seem to disagree — they expressed shock following Amazon’s announcement, with a Sony Music representative implying that the company was looking into legal options. But are licenses required for users to play back music that they have legally purchased, even if that playback is coming from “the cloud?” Continue reading … ' \n",

District officials suspended the first-grade teacher at School 21 in an attempt to quell outrage that nonetheless continued Friday. District officials confirmed the teacher, identified by several sources as Jennifer Schmid O'Brien, has been suspended with pay and that an investigation into the comments is under way. Theodore Best, the school board president, said a \"\"significant\"\" number of parents, having seen the posts Wednesday, arrived at the school to remove their children from her class. On Friday, parents retrieving children at dismissal said they were dumbfounded, angered and disheartened by the comments, and believed the teacher was unfit to remain in the classroom. Some children exiting the school didn't believe it and thought it was an April Fools' joke. Vickie L. White-Franklin, who said Friday that her daughter, Cha'Rashje Franklin, 7, is in O'Brien's class, heard the news earlier in the week. \"\"Our children were disturbed by those comments,\"\" she said. \"\"They will grow up thinking they've already been labeled as a criminal.\"\" \"\"Heartbreaking\"\" Parents called the alleged comments shocking, unprofessional, hurtful and racist. Some said she should teach elsewhere if she's unhappy, while others recommended she be fired and her teaching certificate revoked. \"\"It's heartbreaking,\"\" said Angela Elliott, a parent. \"\"It makes me sad because I put trust in these teachers. They're a part of my kids' future.\"\" Kesha Hopkins, who went to School 21 and grew up nearby, was dropping a cake off at the school Friday for her third-grade son's birthday party. While there are worse parts of the city, she said, \"\"a person like that shouldn't be teaching in this area - an urban area.\"\" Best said the teacher was suspended because reaction to the comments \"\"created serious problems at the school that impeded the functioning of the building.\"\" The board president and other board members were informed of the incident in an emergency executive session Thursday. \"\"You can't simply fire someone for what they have on a Facebook page, but if that spills over and affects the classroom then you can take action,\"\" he said. Darlene Morris, who runs a women's group that works with school parents, said she was in \"\"disbelief\"\" when a parent showed her a printout of the Facebook comments before they were removed. She identified the teacher as O'Brien. O'Brien was a technology coordinator until this year when she was moved into the classroom as part of a staff reshuffling due to last year's layoffs, district officials said. Her annual salary is $60,513, according to the district. \"\"I don't think of it as a white thing or a black thing. Six-year-old children don't have rational minds; they don't always do what we tell them to do,\"\" Morris said. \"\"If you have that kind of attitude toward a child, you're in the wrong place, because you can't help someone you don't like.\"\" Best said he received several text messages from clergy and associates of the NAACP citing the Facebook posts. \"\"This is not the first time I've heard something like this from a teacher,\"\" Best said. \"\"Overall, I think we have really good teachers. But there's also a significant population of teachers here to collect the paycheck and don't have the best interests of the students in mind.\"\" District investigating When asked about the suspension, Superintendent Donnie Evans said: \"\"It's a personnel matter and we've taken action. There is an investigation under way.\"\" Some community activists worry that such derogatory comments could damage the reputation of a neighborhood already plagued with poverty, crime and single-parent households. But one local pastor called the controversy an isolated incident and praised the elementary school overall for showing \"\"nothing but love for the children.\"\" \"\"There might be others [who share the sentiments expressed in the online remarks] but all I've dealt with have shown no signs like that,\"\" said the Rev. Barry Graham, assistant pastor at Canaan Baptist Church on 22nd Street, a block from the school. Graham, whose congregation works closely with the school and recently lauded 130 honor roll students there, recognized that \"\"any one of us on a bad day could lash out.\"\" But, he said, \"\"we can't have anyone with that attitude teaching our children.\"\" Peter Tirri, president of the local teachers union, said he couldn't comment because he has not yet confirmed the Facebook postings. But, he added, \"\"I can't imagine anybody has gone so far as to criticize 3,000 teachers because of allegations against one.\"\" New Jersey Education Association, the statewide teachers union, is providing the Paterson teacher with an attorney, a spokesman said. Trouble elsewhere Online postings have gotten teachers in trouble elsewhere. In August, a high school math and science supervisor in Massachusetts was forced to resign because of her Facebook comments describing students as \"\"germ bags\"\" and parents as \"\"snobby\"\" and \"\"arrogant.\"\" And in February, a high school English teacher in Bucks County, Pa., was suspended with pay, and could lose her job, because she called her students \"\"lazy whiners\"\" in a blog with only a handful of followers. Annamaria Olmedo, who has three children in School 21, said on Friday that many parents are using Facebook to tell other parents about the incident. Some parents felt the suspension was too light and that she should not teach again. \"\"Kids are going to be kids,\"\" said Robin Smith, aunt of School 21 student Yakira Robertson, 11. \"\"She should've kept comments like that to herself.\"\" Staff Writers Patricia Alex and Andrea Alexander contributed to this article.

He is based in Palo Alto and you can follow him on twitter @semilshah Color Labs is assumed to be the newest combatant in the photo-sharing wars. Many people ripped its floppy launch, interface, crashes, and some are feeling creepy about the Chatroulette aspect. Then there was the backlash to the backlash, where believers applauded the vision, risk-taking, and promise of mining meta-data from phones. Even with the latest update pushed out last night to address some of the initial product’s shortcomings, Color remains the most polarizing Silicon Valley startup since Quora's rise and, appropriately enough, folks at Color have been answering questions on the company's Quora topic page. The source of the furor varies from the amount of money raised ($41m) to the team size (27) to the buggy app (despite updates). A good chunk of the backlash is because users perceive it as a photo-sharing service. But, what if Color is more than a photo-sharing service? Color Labs is on the record stating they are more of a data mining company with technology that, operating in concert on the phone, can paint a detailed mosaic of our mobility. Its patent-pending technologies are said to able to place users in proximity to others based on sounds and images, can capture the angle at which we hold our phones, how fast we move them in gestures, and how bright the environment is. And when users actually have the camera open, that's when the real show begins, tagging images, setting context, and opening the type of world Christopher Nolan conceived of in The Dark Knight, when Lucius Fox and Bruce Wayne use cell phone triangulation to create a digital reflection of the real world. At the same time Foursquare and Facebook are clamoring to obtain our location, others already have a much better implicit depiction of our whereabouts and purchasing behaviors, mainly credit card companies and phone companies. For months, Facebook's mobile apps have gently signaled to users if friends have been spotted nearby. A few weeks ago, Foursquare inked a groundbreaking deal with AMEX to tie the app to a payments system. And, a well-known secret in Silicon Valley is that Facebook is hard at work building its own mobile operating system that will bake \"\"social\"\" into as many mobile devices as possible. In order to get more information than credit card companies have, the phone companies need the user's assistance and permission. And in the case of Color, the user has to have the app running, preferably with the camera open - at dinner, at a sports game - along with all the other apps competing for attention in a crowded, fragmented mobile apps marketplace. Color could give phone companies the chance to get as much as, or more, information about us than the credit card companies have. Before any of this can happen, however, the question looms: Will Color be able to withstand this initial backlash, iterate, and keep improving on their app? Some believe the team will find its way. Others believe that in such a competitive environment, it's not possible to get a second chance. The truth is that nobody knows, but if Color weathers this initial storm and is successful, what could it evolve into? My sense is that Color Labs is thinking ahead two to three years, by which time users may grow tired of sorting through a constellation of apps and services to share and broadcast their location, purchases, and pictures. Instead, these features will converge in a slightly smaller number of unified apps. We'll have folks using phones running on Android, iOS, or Facebook variants, among others, and we'll have a chance to leverage features from Color Labs's systems. This is what I believe Color Labs is going after: The augmentation of mobile operating systems. Ultimately, they don't want their service to run as yet another fragmented app on your phone - they want their system to entirely augment mobile operating systems, using their technologies to document every sound, image, movement, transaction, and message your phone transmits or receives. The folks creating this system are building tools for a world in which our mobile phones and tablets will take the place of many of today's traditional computing devices. In this world, users will carry around their wallet, books, and other files in their phones and tablets, docking them into monitors and screens as they move from location to location. This is pure speculation on my part and nothing more than a fun attempt to connect some dots. But if a seamless mobile operating experience is their ultimate goal, this is the type of undertaking that truly needs venture capital, and lots of it. Part of the reason folks may be lashing out against the concept and launch is that, frankly, we haven't seen a concept this big emerge for a while. Everyone loves a big concept, but a concept remains just that until the products gets in the hands of enough users to make a real impression. Color Labs may be on a mission to perfect and harmonize its technologies to dramatically augment the mobile operating experience. Its founders are accomplished, its team is big, its technologies are novel. The brand is polarizing. Its a company that can convince Sequoia Capital to invest about 1.8% of its current fund for the chance to build something fresh from the ground up. It's a company that's being built entirely within a mobile world, an attempt to test the lasting power of Facebook's symmetrical relationships and offer, as Fred Wilson notes, a more \"\"implicit,\"\" or as the company notes, \"\"elastic\"\" network, one that is built with a different set of rules, norms, and permissions that could perhaps more accurately reflect the random ebbs and flows of our social interactions in real life that have yet to be captured fully by any digital network.

Spoiler: It's 8MP! And Sony! The slip up apparently occurred during an interview with Walt Mossberg for a piece in the Wall Street Journal. In the interview, Stringer put forth that a Sony plant based in Japan had been damaged in the recent earthquake, and that the damage would delay a camera sensor part to Apple. Thing is, Sony does not currently ship sensor parts for the iPhone, leading rumor sleuths to deduce the CEO was talking about a future device. If true, this would mean Apple is dumping the OmniVision 5- and 3.2-megapixel cameras currently seated in their iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS devices, and onto Sony's 8MP sensors. Sony is also rumored to be in the running for an OmniVision takeover, so there's that as well. So many moving parts! Related to the damaged facility is the fact that Apple appears to be distancing itself from a June/July iPhone 5 reveal. Delayed parts may have played a part in that. We'll see! ' \n",

Into this neighbourhood, one of the world's hottest social media companies has promised to stride, offering urban rebirth in exchange for a tax break. Taxe incentives to bring businesses to blighted streets are not unusual. But this is San Francisco. And Twitter. The mayor supports the plan, but progressive politicians — and now the city's largest public employee union — call the proposal a poorly crafted giveaway to the rich. The conflict comes at a time when the city's high tech economy teems with energy not seen since before the first Internet bubble burst more than a decade ago. At issue is the city's payroll tax. San Francisco is the only city in California to levy its business tax based on how much companies pay workers, rather than how much money they take in. Since Twitter emerged as a side project of a San Francisco podcasting company in 2006, the business has grown from a handful of employees to a few hundred. With investors pouring money into Twitter, the company expects to grow to more than 3,000. To do that, Twitter needs a lot more space. One option would be to flee to a sprawling suburban campus in Silicon Valley, where adding more employees would not mean adding to the tax bill. But earlier this month, recently appointed Mayor Ed Lee announced what seemed like a winning solution for everyone. Twitter had signed a letter of intent to sign a six-year lease on several hundred thousand square feet of office space in a historic building in the struggling Mid-Market neighbourhood. The only condition: The city must agree to exempt Twitter from paying any new payroll taxes on any additional hires. For a company that expects to add thousands of new of employees in the next few years, the savings would add up quickly. \"\"This is the moment we have been waiting for,\"\" Lee said of the proposed deal. \"\"The transformative nature of an anchor tenant like Twitter will revitalize this community.\"\" Yet in San Francisco, where an overall economy largely untouched by the recession has kept real estate prices among the highest in the country, some low-income residents worry that revitalization will just lead to higher rents. And city employees facing layoffs and contract concessions thanks to a massive budget shortfall resent what they see as a giveaway to venture capitalists and a bailout for landlords. \"\"Who are the (Twitter) investors?\"\" Supervisor John Avalos told The San Francisco Examiner. \"\"Probably some of the wealthiest people in this country. And we are giving them more wealth.\"\" Last Tuesday, members of a neighbourhood group protested outside Twitter's current headquarters, about a mile from the proposed new offices. They accused Twitter of not living up to its pledge to be a good neighbour. They complained neither the city nor the company have considered the low-income residents who would be adversely impacted by rising rents spurred by the prosperity Twitter could bring. \"\"The residents are feeling that if they're not going to benefit from this revitalization that the city is pushing for, it really doesn't make sense for these companies to stay in San Francisco,\"\" said Angelica Cabande, director of South of Market Community Action Network. Twitter declined to comment on the tax-break fracas. As a result of the controversy, a lawmaker on the Board of Supervisors' progressive wing, Ross Mirkarimi, has proposed an alternative measure he says will fix an underlying legal flaw that has led to anxiety among hot tech companies looking to grow. San Francisco's payroll tax is unusual enough, but one provision makes it even more unique. The city in 2004 added language to the tax code to make clear that tax collectors considered stock options a part of employees' compensation and hence taxable as part of the payroll. For tech startups, stock options are one of the most common ways to hold onto employees, especially when a lack of funds doesn't allow them to offer competitive salaries. When lucky companies reach a point where they can make their initial public offering of stock, those options can turn into a major windfall for workers. But for companies in San Francisco, that windfall sticks employers with a huge tax increase right at the time they've issued the stock in an effort to expand. Mirkarimi's proposal would place a two-year moratorium on taxing any company's stock options to ease the fears not just of Twitter, but other San Francisco-based startups like social gaming leader Zynga and consumer review website Yelp. \"\"You don't want to write law in a way that only helps one company or one neighbourhood in one part of the city,\"\" Mirkarimi said. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the Twitter package, and Mirkarimi predicts it will pass even without his vote. If that happens, Service Employees International Union Local 1021, the public employees union, may seek a ballot measure that could delay the deal until voters weigh in. City economic officials paint any failure of the deal not as a loss to Twitter but as a loss for the neighbourhood, where more than half of the available commercial real estate sits vacant. While Twitter is the big fish the city is seeking to catch, any businesses within the geographic zone defined by the legislation would get a similar tax break. \"\"The benefit we want, which is jobs in this area, is not happening without some incentive,\"\" said Jennifer Matz, director of the city's Office of Economic and Workforce Development.

If Apple sold 1 million Verizon iPhones in February, it doesn't show in ComScore's data Click to enlarge. Data: ComScore If you look very closely at the Feb. 2011 data in the chart at right you will see slight uptick in the green line that represents Apple's (AAPL) share of the U.S. smartphone market. It's a subtle change. You might have to enlarge the chart (by clicking) to see it. It reflects, according to the ComScore data released Friday, an increase in the iPhone's market share from 24.7% in January to 25.2% in February - a month, according to ComScore, in which the Verizon iPhone was the best-selling smartphone in America. I point this out because one of the great unsolved mysteries of the smartphone wars is the effect of the arrival in February of the long-awaited iPhone for Verizon (VZ). Judging by ComScore's data, it didn't do much to slow the advance of Google's (GOOG) Android, whose U.S. market share rose that month from 31.2% to 33%. And I would argue that it puts the lie to claims in the press that Verizon sold 1 million iPhones in the first two weeks of February. Proving this is a little tricky, because Apple doesn't break down iPhone sales by country. Moreover, what ComScore is reporting is market shares, not actual unit sold, in a market that itself is growing, according to Gartner, at a rate of more than 70% per year. But here we go: Using Gartner's numbers, 296.6 million smartphones were shipped to U.S. users in 2010 (up from 172 million in 2009), and 46.6 million of them were iPhones. That suggests that Apple was selling iPhones in the U.S. last year at a rate of about 4 million per month, and probably more toward the end of the year. Let's assume, conservatively, that total smartphone sales in the U.S. was 25 million in January and February of this year. If it were true that the Verizon iPhone bumped Apple's sales from 4 million units to more than 5 million in February, Apple's share of the market would have jumped at least 4 percentage points, not the measly 0.5% ComScore observed. This math here is pretty shaky, I'll admit. But it jibes with some first-hand observations. I've seen the kind of crowds that gather outside Apple Stores on those weekends that the company sells 1 million units of anything. Even if, as Verizon reports, 60% of its initial sales were pre-ordered online, you would think if 400,000 people showed up to buy iPhones between Feb. 10 and Feb. 13, someone would have spotted them. Besides, Verizon has been cagey - and Apple silent - about the size of the Verizon iPhone bump. If 1 million iPhones had been purchased first weekend, don't you think - given Steve Jobs' penchant for nice round numbers - that Apple would have issued a press release? We may finally get some answers on April 20, when Apple reports its earnings for the second quarter of 2011. Tune in here for our analysis. Also on Fortune.com: Why are the Verizon lines so short?

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Sony CEO Accidentally Reveals Secret Details about iPhone 5 Sir Howard Stringer, CEO of Sony, accidentally told everyone in the world that his company will be supplying image sensors for Apple‘s iPhone 5. In an interview late Friday with the Wall Street Journal’s Walt Mossberg, the Sony chief was talking about earthquake damage to 15 of the Sony’s factories in Japan, and inadvertently mentioned that a camera sensor made in one of those plants is on its way to Apple, and that sensor would be delayed because of the quake and tsunami. Stringer didn’t specifically say that Sony is building an 8-megapixel image sensor that will go into the iPhone 5, but since Sony is currently not manufacturing any image sensors for Apple, this confirmed that Sony plans to supply components of the iPhone 5. This points to the distinct possibility that in the iPhone 5, Apple will no longer be using those OmniVision 5-megapixel image sensors currently inside the iPhone 4. This is supported by an analyst’s report from February of this year saying that OmniVision might lose out on supplying cameras for the iPhone 5 because OmniVision’s 8-megapixel sensor won’t be ready for the iPhone 5′s rumored mid-summer launch. Because Stringer was talking about the irony of supplying the company’s best camera to Apple, we can only surmise that he was talking about an 8-megapixel sensor. Here’s what The Wall Street Journal wrote about Stringer’s quote when reporting on its own event this morning: Early on, he raised the irony of Sony supplying camera components for Apple devices. It “always puzzles me,” he said. “Why would I make Apple the best camera?” It is unclear what devices he was talking about as Sony isn’t known to supply key camera components, known as image sensors, to Apple; A Sony spokeswoman declined to comment and an Apple spokesperson couldn’t be reached for comment. Stringer’s inadvertent slip also lends credence to the rumors of a delayed release of the iPhone 5. So what do you think, readers? Is this enough evidence for us to bet on a Sony 8-megapixel camera going into the iPhone 5? ' \n",

The Optimum for iPad app also includes the ability to set up DVR recordings, delete recorded shows and browse TV listings, although it doesn't act as a direct remote for the cable box. The last time Fox and Cablevision squared off subscribers couldn't watch their shows on Hulu or two games of the World Series which, along with a long battle over network DVRs, suggests the cable company is prepared to dig its heels in deep on this issue.

You’ve got your cellphone and you are messaging your friends. In the crowd near you, the police start making arrests. Fearing the government will confiscate your phone and investigate your contacts, you push a “panic button” on your phone. It deletes the contacts in your address book and sends out an alert. Such an app wasn’t readily available so the U.S. State Department, acting as a venture capitalist, decided to build one. The State Department tells TechCrunch government funded work is underway to build an Android version of this “panic button” app. No release date has been set. Another version designed to work on low-cost Nokia phones, more common in the developing world, is being considered. No iPhone app is planned for now. The special app, first reported by Reuters, is part of an initiative to promote new technologies for social activists. So far, the State Department has funded $22 million in “Internet freedom programming.” The money goes to innovators in the form of small grants ranging from a few to tens of thousands of dollars. TechCrunch asked who was getting the money, but due to the sensitive nature of the project, the government won’t disclose names. An open, competitive bid process was used to award the grants. While the government isn’t looking for more help building these apps, they may have future projects designed to advance “Internet Freedom” in other ways. Keep an eye on www.grants.gov for any additional info. Some of the past program objectives have included developing technology “to enable users in closed societies to get around firewalls and filters in acutely hostile Internet environments” and training bloggers and activists to safely and anonymously participate in online forums. The effort is another example of how the administration sees the important role social media and technology has played in global politics. In 2009, the U.S. asked Twitter to delay maintenance work so real-time information about the Iranian protests could continue. The White House has also called on Egypt and Libya to restore internet blackouts. The State Department says it’s not just writing checks. The government is trying to use venture capitalist techniques to produce the best results. No, the goal is not to make 10x on the investment. But, the government is supporting a diverse portfolio of innovation rather than just funding big established technologies. It’s providing knowledge and connections, not just cash. And they are investing to incubate a new community focussed on the intersection of technology and human rights. Of course with any well intentioned program, there could be negative side effects. What happens if the panic button app gets into the wrong hands, such as drug dealers or terrorists? A State Department spokesperson tells TechCrunch it’s a legitimate concern and they are taking that into account when planning the distribution and publicity of the app. It seems TechCrunch readers won’t be a problem.

(Keith Lane) Ten years ago, on the TV show “Freaks & Geeks,” James Franco played a burned-out heartthrob who loved 10-sided dice and Dungeons & Dragons. Maybe he wasn’t acting. On Thursday night, Franco turned up at D.C.’s Hotel Monaco. The actor/writer/ soap-star had signed on as donor-bait for a dinner benefiting 826 D.C. — a Columbia Heights nonprofit that’s one part bizarro gift shop, one part Dave Eggers -founded writing center for underprivileged kids. Turns out he’s a geek-dreamboat in real life, too. Dressed in a gray suit and black shirt, Franco bumbled his way through a pre-meal press gaggle. The great reads of his youth? “The Wizard of Oz” and lots of Tolkien. His favorite place to read in the District? “I’m not the D.C. master,” said Franco. For now, he prefers his hotel room. Also, he’s calling it quits on Twitter. “It’s over. You heard it first. It’s still up there, it’s going down,” he explained. “I got in too much trouble.” When he hosted the Oscars in February, Franco’s performance was so stiff that critics accused him of being stoned. But maybe he’s just wired that way. In person, he’s an earnest dude, not standoffish but not inclined to quippy star-babble, either. Questions about art and writing got serious answers. Halfway through dinner, organizers screened the Franco-directed short film “The Clerk’s Tale,” a 15-minute meditation on the sadness and solitude of a men’s formalwear salesman. “See us loosening our ties among you. We are alone,” read the film’s closing text. “There is no longer any need to express ourselves.” Not bad — but probably not what “Pineapple Express” fans were expecting. Some of 826’s star students came onstage to give the actor another grilling. “After you get your PhD and everything, where do you go from there? Where do you see yourself in five years?” asked Angelita Bowden , a senior at Wilson High School. Franco gave the teen his most thoughtful answer. “The degrees, they’re not going to provide work that I can’t get right now. They’re not any kind of endpoint for me. These programs, they just push me to work a lot harder than I would on my own,” he explained. “So I assume I’ll just be doing a lot more of the same.” From Saturday’s Names and Faces column ' \n",

Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Why Microsoft filed a formal complaint about Google and the search giant's reponse Microsoft has made its first-ever formal complaint to antitrust regulators in the Euroean Union, alleging that Google systematically thwarts Internet search competition. This is how Microsoft and Google responded to the complaint. Microsoft: Competition must be fair Posted by Brad Smith Senior vice-president & general counsel, March 30 2011 Microsoft is filing a formal complaint with the European Commission as part of the Commission's ongoing investigation into whether Google has violated European competition law. At the outset, we should be among the first to compliment Google for its genuine innovations, of which there have been many over the past decade. Google has done much to advance its laudable mission to \"\"organise the world's information\"\", but we're concerned by a broadening pattern of conduct aimed at stopping a competitive alternative. We've therefore decided to join a large and growing number of companies registering their concerns about the European search market. By the European Commission's own reckoning, Google has about 95pc of the search market in Europe. This contrasts with the United States, where Microsoft serves about a quarter of Americans' search needs either directly through Bing or through our partnership with Yahoo!. Our filing today focuses on a pattern of actions that Google has taken to entrench its dominance in the markets for online search and search advertising to the detriment of European consumers. How does it do this? Google has built its business on indexing and displaying snippets of other organisations' web content. It understands that search engines depend upon the openness of the web to function properly, and it's quick to complain when others undermine this. Search engines compete to index the web as fully as possible to generate good search results, they compete to gain advertisers – the source of revenue in this business – and distribution of their search boxes through websites. Consumers will not benefit from clicking to alternative sites unless all search engines have a fair opportunity to compete in each of these areas. Our filing details many instances where Google is impeding competition, for instance, since Google acquired YouTube in 2006 it has put in place a growing number of technical measures to restrict competing search engines from properly accessing it for their search results. Microsoft recognises the importance of ensuring that competition laws remain balanced and that technology innovation moves forward. Google: We try to be as open as we can Posted by Matt Cutts, Principal engineer, Search Quality Team, March 2 2010 Recently the European Commission opened a preliminary inquiry into competition complaints. Part of the complaint alleges that Google operates without sufficient transparency into how and why websites rank in our search results. The notion that Google isn't transparent is tough for me to swallow. One of the most widely-discussed parts of Google's scoring has always been PageRank. That \"\"secret ingredient\"\" is hardly a secret. An early paper not only gave the formula for PageRank, but mentioned many of the other signals in Google's ranking, including anchor text, the location of words within documents, the relative proximity of query words in a document, the size and type of fonts used, the raw HTML of each page, and capitalisation of words. Google has continued to publish literally hundreds of research papers over the years. Those papers reveal many of the \"\"secret formulas\"\" for how Google works and document essential infrastructure that Google uses. Some of these papers have spurred not only open-source projects but entire companies in their own right. Academic papers are one thing, but Google also aims to engage and educate in many other ways. In 1999, Sergey Brin [Google co-founder] participated in the first Search Engine Strategies conference for webmasters. In 2001, Google became one of the first search engines to engage online at a publisher forum called WebmasterWorld. We've tried all sorts of experiments to help site owners understand how Google's search ranking works. We've done multiple live webmaster chats online with hundreds of simultaneous participants. We also engage online across the blogosphere to answer questions about Google's practices. The list goes on and on. At Google, we try to be as open as we can, even to the point of helping users export their data out of Google's products. At the same time, we don't think it's unreasonable for any business to have some trade secrets, not least because we don't want to help spammers and crackers game our system. Ultimately, criticising Google for its \"\"secret formula\"\" is an easy claim to make, but it just isn't true. ' \n",
      "Warning! Exception: 'int' object is not subscriptable generated by the following text: 'Twitter tax deal creates classic San Francisco row In the shadow of San Francisco's stately City Hall, sidewalks abound with transients, drugs and crime. Into this neighborhood, one of the world's hottest social media companies has promised to stride, offering urban rebirth in exchange for a tax break. Tax incentives to bring businesses to blighted streets are not unusual. But this is San Francisco. And Twitter. The mayor supports the plan, but progressive politicians _ and now the city's largest public employee union _ call the proposal a poorly crafted giveaway to the rich. The conflict comes at a time when the city's high tech economy teems with energy not seen since before the first Internet bubble burst more than a decade ago. At issue is the city's payroll tax. San Francisco is the only city in California to levy its business tax based on how much companies pay workers, rather than how much money they take in. Since Twitter emerged as a side project of a San Francisco podcasting company in 2006, the business has grown from a handful of employees to a few hundred. With investors pouring money into Twitter, the company expects to grow to more than 3,000. To do that, Twitter needs a lot more space. One option would be to flee to a sprawling suburban campus in Silicon Valley, where adding more employees would not mean adding to the tax bill. But earlier this month, recently appointed Mayor Ed Lee announced what seemed like a winning solution for everyone. Twitter had signed a letter of intent to sign a six-year lease on several hundred thousand square feet of office space in a historic building in the struggling Mid-Market neighborhood. The only condition: The city must agree to exempt Twitter from paying any new payroll taxes on any additional hires. For a company that expects to add thousands of new of employees in the next few years, the savings would add up quickly. \"\"This is the moment we have been waiting for,\"\" Lee said of the proposed deal. \"\"The transformative nature of an anchor tenant like Twitter will revitalize this community.\"\" Yet in San Francisco, where an overall economy largely untouched by the recession has kept real estate prices among the highest in the country, some low-income residents worry that revitalization will just lead to higher rents. And city employees facing layoffs and contract concessions thanks to a massive budget shortfall resent what they see as a giveaway to venture capitalists and a bailout for landlords. \"\"Who are the (Twitter) investors?\"\" Supervisor John Avalos told The San Francisco Examiner. \"\"Probably some of the wealthiest people in this country. And we are giving them more wealth.\"\" Last Tuesday, members of a neighborhood group protested outside Twitter's current headquarters, about a mile from the proposed new offices. They accused Twitter of not living up to its pledge to be a good neighbor. They complained neither the city nor the company have considered the low-income residents who would be adversely impacted by rising rents spurred by the prosperity Twitter could bring. \"\"The residents are feeling that if they're not going to benefit from this revitalization that the city is pushing for, it really doesn't make sense for these companies to stay in San Francisco,\"\" said Angelica Cabande, director of South of Market Community Action Network. Twitter declined to comment on the tax-break fracas. As a result of the controversy, a lawmaker on the Board of Supervisors' progressive wing, Ross Mirkarimi, has proposed an alternative measure he says will fix an underlying legal flaw that has led to anxiety among hot tech companies looking to grow. San Francisco's payroll tax is unusual enough, but one provision makes it even more unique. The city in 2004 added language to the tax code to make clear that tax collectors considered stock options a part of employees' compensation and hence taxable as part of the payroll. For tech startups, stock options are one of the most common ways to hold onto employees, especially when a lack of funds doesn't allow them to offer competitive salaries. When lucky companies reach a point where they can make their initial public offering of stock, those options can turn into a major windfall for workers. But for companies in San Francisco, that windfall sticks employers with a huge tax increase right at the time they've issued the stock in an effort to expand. Mirkarimi's proposal would place a two-year moratorium on taxing any company's stock options to ease the fears not just of Twitter, but other San Francisco-based startups like social gaming leader Zynga and consumer review website Yelp. \"\"You don't want to write law in a way that only helps one company or one neighborhood in one part of the city,\"\" Mirkarimi said. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the Twitter package, and Mirkarimi predicts it will pass even without his vote. If that happens, Service Employees International Union Local 1021, the public employees union, may seek a ballot measure that could delay the deal until voters weigh in. City economic officials paint any failure of the deal not as a loss to Twitter but as a loss for the neighborhood, where more than half of the available commercial real estate sits vacant. While Twitter is the big fish the city is seeking to catch, any businesses within the geographic zone defined by the legislation would get a similar tax break. \"\"The benefit we want, which is jobs in this area, is not happening without some incentive,\"\" said Jennifer Matz, director of the city's Office of Economic and Workforce Development. Without such incentives, she said, the neighborhood has not seen improvement for a generation. \"\"It resisted the last dot-com boom.\"\" ' \n"
